Welcome to my portfolio!
My name is Erin Case, and I'm finishing up my final year here at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I'll graduate with a degree in computer science and a minor in psychology. I've been a Software Engineer Intern at Don't Panic Labs since May of 2024, and I'll be starting as a full-time developer there in February.

This site contains materials (blogs, mockups, etc.) that I created during a semester-long, UI/UX class through the Raikes school at UNL. 

Check out my resume below if you want to know some more about me. Otherwise, enjoy browsing!
