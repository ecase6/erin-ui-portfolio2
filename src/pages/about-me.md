Welcome to my portfolio!
My name is Erin Case, and I'm finishing up my final year here at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I'll graduate with a degree in computer science and a minor in psychology. I've been a Software Engineer Intern at Don't Panic Labs since May of 2024, and I'll be starting as a full-time developer there in February.

Outside of my studies, I love to spend time with my family and friends, listen to music, and be creative (crafts and DIYs are my favorites). Creating things fills my cup, especially when I'm creating for other people. *(Hint: Check out my [Projects](/projects) or [Design Narrative](/blog/designNarrative) to see my creativity at work.)*

This site contains materials (blogs, mockups, etc.) that I created during a semester-long, UI/UX class through the Raikes school at UNL. 

Check out my resume below if you want to know some more about me. Otherwise, enjoy browsing!
