Some other groups that were represented were first-time voters, elderly, and individuals with visual impairments. We had to communicate with each other and work together to ensure that the needs of each population were met in some capacity. \\n\\nTo give you some more insight to the workshop, I\'ll share some of the things I learned about individuals with hand tremors in regards to their UI needs. Hand tremors cause involuntary shaking of the hands, which makes clicking and interacting with websites/apps difficult and frustrating at times. Here are just a few things that would make navigiating UIs easier for them: \\n- large buttons (ideally at least 48x48px)\\n- space between clickable targets (to help prevent misclicks)\\n- keyboard functionality\\n- reviews before submissions\\n- opportunities to fix errors \\n- simple layouts\\n\\nThe negotiations were very civil and rather quiet. I think we all recognized the importance of the needs of each population, and we wanted to make sure each group was satisfied with the results. No one wanted to \\"bulldoze\\" the conversation and place their groups\' needs above others. \\n\\nI advocated for a number of the needs listed above. However, the one\'s I placed at top priority were button size/spacing and keyboard functionality. I quickly realized that the other needs on the list were needs that other populations need and would benefit from as well, so it wasn\'t difficult to advocate for those. Throughout the workshop, the number of needs we could add to the \\"pretend project backlog\\" got smaller and smaller. So, I had to focus mostly on the needs of my population that would also benefit others. \\n\\nOne unlikely ally I had was with the person representing indivduals with anxiety. Specifically when it came to being able to prevent/fix errors as often as the user would need. I didn\'t think any of the representatives were hard to convince. Everyone was understanding, and we were working together to get the best outcome for everyone. \\n\\nIt was hard for me to not be able to ensure that all of my groups\' needs would be met. Prioritizing these needs was difficult because I am not a member of the group I was representing. However, I understood that in order for everyone to get the best outcome, we would all have to compromise. \\n\\nHere are some of my takeaways: \\n- It\'s important to not only advocate for the needs that are important to you (or the group that you\'re representing), but to also recognize and advocate for the needs of others\\n- Compromise is necessary to reach an outcome that is best for everyone\\n- Finding allies is important to ensure that your ideas are supported\\n\\nI think that all of the above are applicable in any matter where teamwork is involved. This could be at work, school, etc. The best solutions are the ones that benefit *everyone*."},{"id":"/inclusiveDesign1","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/inclusiveDesign1","source":"@site/blog/inclusiveDesign1.md","title":"Inclusive Design 1","description":"In response to Don\'t Make Me Think Chapter 12 by Steve Krug","date":"2024-10-29T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/free-form"}],"readingTime":1.405,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Inclusive Design 1","slug":"/inclusiveDesign1","date":"2024-10-29T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["FreeForm"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"UIUN Summit Reflection","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/summitReflection"},"nextItem":{"title":"Inclusive Design 2","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/inclusiveDesign2"}},"content":"*In response to Don\'t Make Me Think Chapter 12 by Steve Krug*\\n\\nWhile reading this chapter I thought about how accessibility shouldn\'t just be a nice-to-have, it should be treated like a non-negotiable. Making a website or app accessible isn\'t just about following a set of rules, it\u2019s about designing for people. And even if those people aren\'t standing right in front of us, their needs are real and valid.\\n\\nKrug hit on something powerful when they said, \u201cit\u2019s profoundly the right thing to do.\u201d Accessibility isn\'t just about covering a legal requirement or making a site \\"usable\\" for most people, it\'s about asking ourselves what we owe to those who need our technology the most. Every small change we make for accessibility has the power to dramatically improve someone\u2019s experience. \\n\\nIn class and at work, it\'s common to often hear about creating \\"good design\\" or \u201cuser-centered design,\u201d but it\u2019s easy to forget who \u201cthe user\u201d is when we\'re rushing to meet deadlines or cramming features into limited time. Accessibility teaches us to slow down and think more broadly about who we\u2019re designing for and to remember that every user is a real person with unique needs and perspectives. This reminder feels crucial as I step into the tech industry. I want to create something that everyone can use.\\n\\nThis chapter also gave me some practical takeaways I can use right away, like adding alt text to images and using semantic HTML structures. Accessibility might take a bit of extra time and might not show up as \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cfancy\u201d in the design itself, but it\u2019s the kind of work that makes a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/accessability.jpeg)"},{"id":"/inclusiveDesign2","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/inclusiveDesign2","source":"@site/blog/inclusiveDesign2.md","title":"Inclusive Design 2","description":"In response to The Design of Everyday Things Chapter 4 by Don Norman","date":"2024-10-29T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/free-form"}],"readingTime":1.13,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Inclusive Design 2","slug":"/inclusiveDesign2","date":"2024-10-29T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["FreeForm"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Inclusive Design 1","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/inclusiveDesign1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Debriefing User Tests","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/debriefingUserTests"}},"content":"*In response to The Design of Everyday Things Chapter 4 by Don Norman*\\n\\nReading about how we approach using something completely unfamiliar, I thought about the way we rely on two distinct kinds of knowledge: what\u2019s in the world around us and what\u2019s in our heads.\\n\\nThe chapter explained how physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints help us make decisions.

It turns out most of the issues are simpler than we\'d imagine. Some include:\\n\\n- Users don\u2019t get it. Sometimes, people just look at your site and are completely lost. Either they can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s for, or they think they know and they\u2019re totally wrong.\\n\\n- They can\u2019t find the right words. They\u2019re searching for something, but the words on your site don\u2019t match what they\u2019d expect. \\n\\n- Too much clutter. Ever had what you need right in front of you but you just couldn\u2019t see it? That happens to users too. When there\u2019s too much going on, people can miss what\u2019s important. Sometimes the solution is to simplify the page or make key elements stand out more.\\n\\nAfter each round of testing, Krug recommends a quick debrief, ideally over pizza, to decide what needs fixing. The idea is to focus on the biggest problems first and avoid getting distracted by minor things. Here\u2019s his approach:\\n\\n- List the top issues. Go around the room and have everyone share what they saw as the three biggest problems. Write them down\u2014no discussion yet, just listing them.\\n\\n- Prioritize. Once you\u2019ve got the list, pick the ten most important problems and rank them from worst to least urgent.\\n\\n- Create a plan. For each of the top problems, figure out how you\u2019ll fix it, who will handle it, and what resources they\u2019ll need. The goal isn\u2019t to fix every problem perfectly, but to make enough progress that the big issues are no longer deal-breakers.\\n\\nKrug\u2019s advice is also to resist the urge to add more stuff when users are confused. Instead of piling on explanations, sometimes the best solution is to take things away and make the page simpler. And if a user suggests a new feature, take it with a grain of salt because they\u2019ll often realize that they wouldn\u2019t even use it themselves.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/perspective.jpeg)"},{"id":"/userTesting101","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/userTesting101","source":"@site/blog/userTesting101.md","title":"User Testing 101","description":"In response to Don\'t Make Me Think Chapters 8 and 9","date":"2024-10-25T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"WordJournal","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/word-journal"}],"readingTime":1.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"User Testing 101","slug":"/userTesting101","date":"2024-10-25T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["WordJournal"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Debriefing User Tests","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/debriefingUserTests"},"nextItem":{"title":"Feedback Workshop","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/feedback"}},"content":"*In response to Don\'t Make Me Think Chapters 8 and 9*\\n\\nIf I had to choose one word to capture Chapter 8, it would be \\"Perspective\\". This chapter highlights how our professional and personal perspectives shape, and often complicate, our approach to usability in design. Designers, developers, marketers, and all other roles bring their own strong beliefs about what makes a great user experience. This can often clashing over details based on what matters most to them. For designers, it might be the visual aesthetic of a page, while for developers, it\u2019s the clever and efficient functionality. And because we\u2019re all technology users, we tend to project our preferences onto others, assuming other people want what we like.\\n\\nThis concept of perspective is important for me to remember in my career because it emphasizes the importance of staying open-minded. Recognizing different perspectives helps shift the focus from what I or others think users want to what users actually need. That\u2019s where usability testing becomes essential. By stepping outside of our personal viewpoints, we can rely on user feedback to ground our designs in real-world use. This perspective shift can make decisions easier and lead to better, more user-focused designs that work for everyone.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/testing.jpeg)"},{"id":"/feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/feedback","source":"@site/blog/feedback.md","title":"Feedback Workshop","description":"In response to https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/give-designers-feedback/","date":"2024-10-17T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ApproximateAnalogy","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/approximate-analogy"}],"readingTime":1.165,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Feedback Workshop","slug":"/feedback","date":"2024-10-17T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["ApproximateAnalogy"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"User Testing 101","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/userTesting101"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mockups","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/mockups"}},"content":"*In response to https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/give-designers-feedback/*\\n\\nProviding feedback to designers is like giving instructions to a chef. If you say, \u201cMake me something delicious,\u201d the chef has to guess what you like, and the result might not align with your expectations. However, if you\u2019re clear and specific, the chef has the guidance needed to create something that satisfies your taste and dietary needs. Just as a chef benefits from understanding your preferences and restrictions, a designer needs actionable and detailed feedback to craft a design that matches your vision.\\n\\nDesigners, much like chefs, work with \u201cingredients\u201d: color palettes, typography, layouts, user interactions, etc. These elements can be combined in lots of ways, and without guidance, a designer may produce work that doesn\u2019t fully meet your goals or needs.

One of the main takeaways is the concept of \\"the first law of usability,\\" which states that a user interface should be self-evident. This means that users shouldn\u2019t have to think too much to understand how something works; they should be able to glance at a webpage or an app and know immediately what to do. This principle is central to creating effective digital experiences because it reduces cognitive load and frustration. This allows users to focus on their goals rather than trying to figure out confusing navigation or design elements.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Presentation Zen (Chapters 2 and 4) by Reynolds focuses on effective presentation design, with an emphasis on simplicity and storytelling. In Chapter 2, Reynolds introduces the idea of \\"restraint\\" in design, using only what is necessary to convey your message without overwhelming your audience with excessive text, data, etc. Chapter 4 expands on this by discussing the importance of visual clarity and the power of storytelling. A compelling narrative paired with clean, minimal slides can make presentations more engaging.\\n\\nWhen we merge these ideas from both books, the ideas of simplicity, clarity, and engagement are apparent, whether you\'re designing a user interface or delivering a presentation. In both cases, the goal is to guide your audience without distracting or confusing them. Just as Krug advises designers to create user interfaces that don\'t require thought, Reynolds advises presenters to strip away unnecessary clutter so that the core message stands out.\\n\\nAs someone working in software development, these lessons are incredibly relevant. Whether I\u2019m collaborating on a UI project or preparing a presentation, balancing simplicity and engagement will be important. In user interface design, I\u2019ve learned that every additional button, menu, or piece of text is a potential point of confusion for the user. The more straightforward the interface, the easier it will be for the user to accomplish their goals.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/clarity.jpeg)"},{"id":"/PortfoliosAndDesignNarratives","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/PortfoliosAndDesignNarratives","source":"@site/blog/portfoliosAndDesignNarratives.md","title":"Portfolios & Design Narratives","description":"In response to https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-portfolio-examples/","date":"2024-10-15T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/free-form"}],"readingTime":0.975,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Portfolios & Design Narratives","slug":"/PortfoliosAndDesignNarratives","date":"2024-10-15T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["FreeForm"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Mockups","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/mockups"},"nextItem":{"title":"Navigation and Values","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/navigationAndValues"}},"content":"*In response to https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-portfolio-examples/*\\n\\nThis piece does a good job at demonstrating how each of the portfolios are unique and show off the designer\'s individuality, but still manages to be consistent and easy to use.

Gordon. This is a six-color lithograph created in 1974 and is part of the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln\'s collection, gifted by Dr. Christopher and Janet Graf. Gordon, an American artist, was born in Philadelphia in 1936 and later passed in Montreal in 2013. The artwork portrays a surreal scene where a hot dog stretches across two canyon-like formations, set against a vivid background featuring a bright blue sky, white clouds, and a rainbow. This whimsical combination of elements evokes nostalgia, inviting viewers to embrace humor and lightheartedness during challenging times.\\n\\n**Analysis**\\n\\n1. Color Balance\\n\\nThe vibrant color palette used in Hot Dog Bridge immediately grabs attention. The contrast between the bright blue sky, the bold rainbow, and the warm tones of the rocks creates a balanced and dynamic visual experience. The hot dog, an iconic and familiar object, stands out against the surreal background and magnifies the humor in the piece. The combination of these bold and simplified colors creates a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere.\\n\\n*The above ideas are influenced by Joseph Albers\u2019 Interaction of Color, which discusses the importance of contrast in evoking emotion through colors.*\\n\\n2. Surrealism and Humor \\n\\nAt first glance, the piece\'s absurdity is what draws you in. A hot dog spanning a canyon is not a typical sight. This constract between reality and imagination is central to surrealism. It encourages people to find meaning in the nonsensical, which is exactly what happened for me while viewing this piece. The surreal nature of the work, paired with its lighthearted humor, represents a comforting escape from ther seriousness and challenges of the \\"real-world\\".\\n\\n*The above ideas are influenced by Salvador Dal\xed\u2019s works, which often use juxtaposition to inspire thought beyond the obvious.*\\n\\n3. Simplicity of Forms \\n\\nGordon\'s use of clean, simplified shapes, like geometric clouds, smooth curves of the hot dog, and blocky rocks creates a unified look that is easy to process visually. Despite the bizarre concept, the clarity and simplicity of the forms make it accessible to viewers. This is a prime example of how minimalistic design choices can strengthen the overall impact of a surreal composition, allowing each element to stand out clearly.\\n\\n*The above ideas are influenced by Wassily Kandinsky\'s Point and Line to Plane, which offers insights into how basic forms and geometry influence perception in art.*\\n\\n**UI Sketch**\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/hotdogUISketch.jpg)\\n\\nThis hand-drawn sketch above represents a mobile app screen. The inspiration behind this idea was the way that I open up my notes app nearly every day to make quick to-do lists, often with only a couple of items. I thought it would be much more fun if my lists were more whimsy and playful, like this piece of art. So, the main functionality is a simple todo list, where the user drags the hot dog across the canyon once they complete a task, symbolizing the \\"bridge\\" of completing a task. So, the hot dog would start short and end up quite long. \\n\\nI felt that displaying a hand-drawn sketch alone would not capture everything I was inspired by. Color, whim, surrealism, and humor were main aspects of my inspiration, so I did a quick design on Canva to try to convey the playful vibe I wanted to display, as color is very important to my thoughts on this.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/hotdogUI.png)\\n\\nThrough this process, I\u2019ve learned how surrealist art can inspire UI design by embracing imagination and playfulness, even in something as simple and mundane as a to-do app. Using bold colors and simplifying forms allows a balance between creative inspiration and accessibility, making interfaces both functional and delightful."},{"id":"/designSystems","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designSystems","source":"@site/blog/designSystems.md","title":"Design Systems","description":"In response to various articles on designsystems.com","date":"2024-09-30T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ApproximateAnalogy","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/approximate-analogy"}],"readingTime":2.525,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Design Systems","slug":"/designSystems","date":"2024-09-30T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["ApproximateAnalogy"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Finding Inspiration","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/findingInspiration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Color Study","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorStudy"}},"content":"*In response to various articles on designsystems.com*\\n\\n**Design systems are to a well-organized library as the combination of spatial grids, typography, and content strategy are to the shelves, book arrangements, and catalog system.**\\n\\nEach part of the design system plays an important role in making the library easy to navigate and efficient to use. Just as every component in a library needs to work together to create a positive user experience, the same applies to design systems.\\n\\nIn a library, spatial grids are like the well-spaced shelves and clearly defined aisles. They create a visual and physical structure that makes navigating easy. If the shelves are poorly arranged or spaced unevenly, it would be difficult for people to find their way. Similarly, in a design system, spatial grids ensure that the layout of elements is predictable and uniform across different pages and components. This allows users to navigate interfaces easily and reinforces trust in the product, similar to how visitors trust a well-organized library to fulfill its purpose. The *Space, Grids, and Layouts* article emphasizes how spatial systems create visual rhythm and help reduce decision-making for designers. This same idea is like how people in libraries don\u2019t need to think about how the aisles are structured, they just follow the natural flow.\\n\\nTypography is like the labels on books, shelves, and sections within the library. Good typography ensures that users can quickly understand what each section holds. In design, clear, readable fonts with well-defined hierarchies ensure that users can scan and read content easily. Just as a library with inconsistent labeling would confuse its visitors, a product with inconsistent typography would frustrate its users. In the *Typography* article, it\u2019s noted how font choices, weights, and line-heights are critical in creating a consistent design language. For a designer, mastering typography means ensuring that every piece of text conveys the right tone and importance, just like how a library carefully chooses its signage to direct people.\\n\\nLastly, content strategy functions like the library\u2019s cataloging system. It tells users where to find what they need, how to use the resources effectively, and what to expect in each section. Without a content strategy, users may feel lost or overwhelmed. For example, if books were organized randomly without a coherent strategy, finding information would be impossible. The *Guide to Content Strategy* article emphasizes how vital it is to standardize how content appears across different UI elements. In the same way that a library catalog makes finding information easier, a strong content strategy helps users understand and navigate interfaces.\\n\\nDesign systems bring order to chaos, just like a well-maintained library does. By understanding how spatial grids, typography, and content strategy work together, as a designer I\'ll be able to save time, reduce complexity, and provide a more intuitive experience for users. Consistency and ease of use directly impact a product\u2019s success. These principles ensure that you\u2019re building something that\u2019s not just functional, but also scalable, like a well-architected library that can continue to grow without losing its organization.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/library.jpeg)"},{"id":"/colorStudy","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorStudy","source":"@site/blog/colorStudy.md","title":"Color Study","description":"The Drink Half Past website has a UI that stands out to me, and I\'d like to take some time to study it and","date":"2024-09-26T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/free-form"}],"readingTime":4.59,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Color Study","slug":"/colorStudy","date":"2024-09-26T15:30:00.000Z","tags":["FreeForm"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Design Systems","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designSystems"},"nextItem":{"title":"Colors I","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorsI"}},"content":"The *Drink Half Past* website has a UI that stands out to me, and I\'d like to take some time to study it and \\nexperiment with the colors on the page.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/drinkHalfPast.png)\\n\\nThe original color scheme in the screenshot primarily uses pastel shades:\\n- Pink (Grapefruit with Rosemary)\\n- Peachy orange (Ginger with Turmeric)\\n- Soft green (Spicy Lime)\\n- Light yellow (Pineapple with Clove)\\nThese background colors are similar to the colors of the cans. \\n\\nThe buttons at the bottom of each drink card are variations of green, blue, and purple (the same color as the labels on the can). The text is mainly black, with the product names using bold, block-like fonts in dark contrasting colors, making them stand out clearly.\\n\\nThis color scheme fits into a split complementary color scheme. Pastel shades of pink, green, yellow, and peach provide soft, harmonious contrasts while the bold colors of the text and cans create focal points. The color choices also feel fresh and organic, matching the natural, vibrant qualities the brand wants to communicate.\\n\\nThe designers seem to be going for a clean, fresh, and somewhat playful mood. The pastel tones feel light and refreshing, suggesting the natural flavors/ingredients in the drinks. The bold product names give an energetic vibe, helping to reinforce the feeling of excitement and adventure in trying new flavors.\\n\\n**Recreation 1: Light Blue Monochromatic Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI1.png)\\nThis version features soft, pastel-like blue tones across the entire design. The background of each flavor card uses light shades of blue with different levels of saturation, while the buttons and text follow a similar light color scheme.\\nIt gives a calm, clean, and refreshing feel. The light blue tones evoke a sense of trust and reliability, making the design feel professional and safe. Its cool tones imply cooling and refreshing factors in the beverage. However, the lack of strong contrast between product cards might make it harder to differentiate between flavors at a glance. While it\u2019s visually cohesive, it could feel a bit monotonous for users seeking variety in the product options.\\n\\n**Recreation 2: Earthy Analogous Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI2.png)\\nThis version uses a palette of greens and yellows. Each card features either a light yellow or green background, with slightly darker buttons to contrast. The analogous colors (adjacent on the color wheel) create a natural, harmonious vibe. This design has a very organic, earthy feel, which reflects the idea of natural ingredients and freshness. The yellow and green tones make it feel health-conscious and environmentally friendly. The analogous colors work well together, creating a balanced and cohesive look without clashing. This version is effective in emphasizing the natural qualities of the products but might lack the visual \\"pop\\" needed to grab users\' attention quickly. It\u2019s subtle and pleasing, but not as exciting as other schemes.\\n\\n**Recreation 3: High-Contrast Complementary Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI3.png)\\n\\nIn this version, bright orange backgrounds are paired with blue accents for a bold, complementary color scheme. The contrast is striking, and the colors create a strong visual division between product sections. The orange and blue combination conveys energy, excitement, and urgency. This high-contrast scheme draws immediate attention and creates a dynamic, lively feel. It could be particularly effective in grabbing the attention of users who are quickly browsing the page. The complementary scheme is highly effective in making the UI engaging and attention-grabbing. However, the intensity of the colors may feel a bit overwhelming to some users, especially if they\'re used to more neutral designs. Still, for an energetic, adventurous brand, this could work very well.\\n\\n**Recreation 4: Triadic Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI4.png)\\nThe triadic scheme features a balance between purple, green, and yellow. Each product card has one of these three colors in a light, pastel tone, and the buttons use muted versions of the same colors to keep the palette consistent. This design feels playful and creative. The triadic color scheme keeps the page dynamic without the high tension of a complementary scheme. The colors are bright but not overpowering, giving a sense of fun and variety while maintaining balance. This scheme is effective in creating visual interest without overwhelming the user. It strikes a balance between contrast and harmony, making it one of the most engaging versions. It allows each product to stand out while still keeping a unified design. It could appeal to users looking for a fun, energetic brand experience.\\n\\nEach color scheme has its strengths, but the Triadic Scheme (4) stands out as the most effective overall for the following reasons: \\n\\nVariety/Balance: The triadic scheme offers visual variety while maintaining balance. It provides contrast without overwhelming the user, making the UI both dynamic and visually interesting.\\n\\nMood: The playful, vibrant tones fit the personality of a brand that sells unique and exciting beverages. It appeals to users\' sense of curiosity and fun.\\n\\nFunctionality: The differentiation between each product card is clear, making it easy for users to distinguish between flavors while still feeling like the entire page is cohesive.\\n\\nThis scheme would likely be the most engaging for users while maintaining the product\u2019s fresh and lively feel. It is the most similar to the original design, which I think is really great UI. In my version, though, I leaned into the triadic design more. However, this doesn\'t reflect the flavors as well as the original does. \\n\\nWhile I don\'t think it\'s the most effective, I did love the boldness and edginess of Recreation 3. Everyone has their own opinions and taste!"},{"id":"/colorsI","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorsI","source":"@site/blog/colorsI.md","title":"Colors I","description":"In response to pages 8-25 of Expert color information for professional color results.

Rockport Publishers.*\\n\\nReading about the different types of color schemes at the beginning of this section of the book immediately made \\nme think of the schemes that I gravitate towards. I really enjoy clash and complementary schemes, and I found examples\\nof both of these on posters I have hung up in my room. Not only have I seen these schemes in my posters, but I\'ve also \\nseen them in lots of other decor and even some UI. \\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/freePoster.jpg)\\n\\nThe above poster has a mix of muted green and blue with big red letters that jump out aggressively. This is a prime example of what\u2019s known as a clash scheme\u2014where colors that aren\'t quite opposites on the color wheel create visual tension. The green and blue of the background sit comfortably together, but the red stands out. It\u2019s bold, unexpected, and it demands attention.\\n\\nIn UI design, clash schemes can be powerful but intense. They demand attention. I can think of a button in an app that\u2019s an intense color against a muted background. This kind of contrast can drive action, but it can also overwhelm the user. I think the trick would be to use clashing colors intentionally, in small amounts, to direct the user\u2019s focus without causing discomfort or cognitive overload.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/tylerPoster.jpg)\\n\\nIn this other poster, above, it is dominated by blue, with a man in a yellow suit. This follows a complementary color scheme. Blue and yellow sit opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a nice, unique balance. This type of scheme is great for catching the eye while maintaining a sense of cohesion and calm. The yellow suit pops against the blue background, but in a way that feels less confrontational than the clash of red, green, and blue in the first poster.\\n\\nIn UI design, complementary colors can help create emphasis without overwhelming the user. A blue interface with strategically placed yellow elements\u2014buttons, icons, or text would be a good idea. It\u2019s like giving them visual cues without shouting.\\n\\nMy posters will be a reminder of how different color schemes evoke different emotions. Clash schemes can create excitement, urgency, or even discomfort when needed, but must be used carefully. They\u2019re great for making something stand out, like error messages or call-to-action buttons, but too much can overwhelm users. On the other hand, complementary schemes offer contrast in a way that\u2019s pleasing to the eye. This balance is ideal for creating interfaces that feel both engaging and easy to navigate. When users are working through a complex app or website, they don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being bombarded with too much intensity. Complementary colors offer that subtle touch.\\n\\nBoth posters and both color schemes have their place. I think that the key to UI, much like in art, is knowing which tool to use at the right moment."},{"id":"/aestheticDesign","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/aestheticDesign","source":"@site/blog/aestheticDesign.md","title":"Aesthetic Design","description":"In response to Chapter 6 of Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery.

New Riders.*\\n\\nAfter reading about \\"The Big Four\\" design principles\u2014Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in the reading, I thought about ways these ideas are common in life that have nothing to do with screens or the internet.\\n\\nFor example: contrast. This principle is everywhere, like when picking out an outfit. Wearing a black or neutral colored dress with a red bag/accessory makes the red stand out and adds interest to the look. The reading emphasized how contrast helps important elements pop, which is the same reason why we might pair a bold accessory with a simple outfit. \\n\\nRepetition is a big part of interior design, like in the way a cozy room might have the same vibe of decor or the same color throughout the space. This creates a sense of unity, just as the book describes. \\n\\nAlignment made me think about hanging up pictures to create a \u201cgallery wall\u201d. When things are lined up intentionally, it instantly makes the space look more organized and visually pleasing. The reading pointed out how alignment brings order to a design, which is why we naturally line things up in our surroundings, it just feels right.\\n\\nLastly, proximity made me think of arranging items on a kitchen counter. We instinctively group things that go together, like coffee mugs next to the coffee maker or utensils close to the stove. The reading\u2019s point about proximity helping to show relationships between items clicked with me when I thought of how we organize our physical spaces to be more functional.\\n\\nUnderstanding these principles will definitely help in my future as a software engineer. When designing software, applying contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity can make an app\u2019s layout as cohesive as outfits or gallery walls. It\u2019s all about creating an experience that feels natural and easy to navigate, just like how we arrange things in our everyday spaces.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/redBag.jpeg)"},{"id":"/designRules","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designRules","source":"@site/blog/designRules.md","title":"Design Rules","description":"In response to Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of: Krug, S.

This is why Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) and the use of Conventions are important. If a website or app follows established patterns, it makes it easier for users to look through and find what they need.\\n\\nThe relationship between Navigation Clarity (Chapter 4) and Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) is crucial. A well-designed hierarchy can improve navigation by highlighting what\'s important and where users need to go (e.g., having breadcrumbs). Together, these help users feel in control and avoid getting lost.\\n\\nMinimizing unnecessary text (Chapter 5) works hand-in-hand with reducing visual noise (Chapter 3). This combination helps reduce cognitive load, making it easier for users to process content quickly without being overwhelmed. Clickability from Chapter 3 also ties into this, as clear, concise instructions should guide users to the right actions.\\n\\nAcross all chapters, Krug reinforces that the core focus should always be usability, whether through simplifying text, improving navigation, or designing with conventions in mind. Each chapter adds another layer to this, highlighting that the easier we make it for users, the more successful the product will be.\\n\\nUnderstanding these relationships is important to create user-friendly apps/websites. By internalizing how users think and interact with digital products, I\'ll be able to design solutions that reduce frustration, improve engagement, and lead to better overall satisfaction. Whether I\'m developing a database or designing a feature in my future software engineering work, these ideas will be helpful while trying to create intuitive, effective solutions.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/hierarchy.jpeg)"},{"id":"/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","source":"@site/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg.md","title":"Schneiderman & Info Org","description":"In response to Shneiderman, B.
