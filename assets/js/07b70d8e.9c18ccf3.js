The text is mainly black, with the product names using bold, block-like fonts in dark contrasting colors, making them stand out clearly.\\n\\nThis color scheme fits into a split complementary color scheme. Pastel shades of pink, green, yellow, and peach provide soft, harmonious contrasts while the bold colors of the text and cans create focal points. The color choices also feel fresh and organic, matching the natural, vibrant qualities the brand wants to communicate.\\n\\nThe designers seem to be going for a clean, fresh, and somewhat playful mood. The pastel tones feel light and refreshing, suggesting the natural flavors/ingredients in the drinks. The bold product names give an energetic vibe, helping to reinforce the feeling of excitement and adventure in trying new flavors.\\n\\n**Recreation 1: Light Blue Monochromatic Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI1.png)\\nThis version features soft, pastel-like blue tones across the entire design. The background of each flavor card uses light shades of blue with different levels of saturation, while the buttons and text follow a similar light color scheme.\\nIt gives a calm, clean, and refreshing feel. The light blue tones evoke a sense of trust and reliability, making the design feel professional and safe. Its cool tones imply cooling and refreshing factors in the beverage. However, the lack of strong contrast between product cards might make it harder to differentiate between flavors at a glance. While it\u2019s visually cohesive, it could feel a bit monotonous for users seeking variety in the product options.\\n\\n**Recreation 2: Earthy Analogous Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI2.png)\\nThis version uses a palette of greens and yellows. Each card features either a light yellow or green background, with slightly darker buttons to contrast. The analogous colors (adjacent on the color wheel) create a natural, harmonious vibe. This design has a very organic, earthy feel, which reflects the idea of natural ingredients and freshness. The yellow and green tones make it feel health-conscious and environmentally friendly. The analogous colors work well together, creating a balanced and cohesive look without clashing. This version is effective in emphasizing the natural qualities of the products but might lack the visual \\"pop\\" needed to grab users\' attention quickly. It\u2019s subtle and pleasing, but not as exciting as other schemes.\\n\\n**Recreation 3: High-Contrast Complementary Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI3.png)\\n\\nIn this version, bright orange backgrounds are paired with blue accents for a bold, complementary color scheme. The contrast is striking, and the colors create a strong visual division between product sections. The orange and blue combination conveys energy, excitement, and urgency. This high-contrast scheme draws immediate attention and creates a dynamic, lively feel. It could be particularly effective in grabbing the attention of users who are quickly browsing the page. The complementary scheme is highly effective in making the UI engaging and attention-grabbing. However, the intensity of the colors may feel a bit overwhelming to some users, especially if they\'re used to more neutral designs. Still, for an energetic, adventurous brand, this could work very well.\\n\\n**Recreation 4: Triadic Scheme**\\n![Error getting image](/img/halfPastUI4.png)\\nThe triadic scheme features a balance between purple, green, and yellow. Each product card has one of these three colors in a light, pastel tone, and the buttons use muted versions of the same colors to keep the palette consistent. This design feels playful and creative. The triadic color scheme keeps the page dynamic without the high tension of a complementary scheme. The colors are bright but not overpowering, giving a sense of fun and variety while maintaining balance. This scheme is effective in creating visual interest without overwhelming the user. It strikes a balance between contrast and harmony, making it one of the most engaging versions. It allows each product to stand out while still keeping a unified design. It could appeal to users looking for a fun, energetic brand experience.\\n\\nEach color scheme has its strengths, but the Triadic Scheme (4) stands out as the most effective overall for the following reasons: \\n\\nVariety/Balance: The triadic scheme offers visual variety while maintaining balance. It provides contrast without overwhelming the user, making the UI both dynamic and visually interesting.\\n\\nMood: The playful, vibrant tones fit the personality of a brand that sells unique and exciting beverages. It appeals to users\' sense of curiosity and fun.\\n\\nFunctionality: The differentiation between each product card is clear, making it easy for users to distinguish between flavors while still feeling like the entire page is cohesive.\\n\\nThis scheme would likely be the most engaging for users while maintaining the product\u2019s fresh and lively feel. It is the most similar to the original design, which I think is really great UI. In my version, though, I leaned into the triadic design more. However, this doesn\'t reflect the flavors as well as the original does. \\n\\nWhile I don\'t think it\'s the most effective, I did love the boldness and edginess of Recreation 3. Everyone has their own opinions and taste!"},{"id":"/colorsI","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorsI","source":"@site/blog/colorsI.md","title":"Colors I","description":"In response to pages 8-25 of Expert color information for professional color results.

Narrowing down a palette to just a few colors will keep the design clean and user-friendly, which is key in building intuitive software. This exercise showed me that every color choice should be intentional, creating a visual experience that reflects the project\'s purpose."},{"id":"/colorsII","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorsII","source":"@site/blog/colorsII.md","title":"Colors II","description":"In response to pages 26-55 and 176-191 of Expert color information for professional color results.

Rockport Publishers.*\\n\\nReading about the different types of color schemes at the beginning of this section of the book immediately made \\nme think of the schemes that I gravitate towards. I really enjoy clash and complementary schemes, and I found examples\\nof both of these on posters I have hung up in my room. Not only have I seen these schemes in my posters, but I\'ve also \\nseen them in lots of other decor and even some UI. \\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/3colors.png)\\n\\nThe above poster has a mix of green and blue with big red letters that jump out aggressively. This is a prime example of what\u2019s known as a clash scheme\u2014where colors that aren\'t quite opposites on the color wheel create visual tension. The green and blue of the background sit comfortably together, but the red stands out. It\u2019s bold, unexpected, and it demands attention.\\n\\nIn UI design, clash schemes can be powerful but intense. They demand attention. I can think of a button in an app that\u2019s an intense color against a muted background. This kind of contrast can drive action, but it can also overwhelm the user. I think the trick would be to use clashing colors intentionally, in small amounts, to direct the user\u2019s focus without causing discomfort or cognitive overload.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/3colors.png)\\n\\nIn this other poster, above, it is dominated by blue, with a man in a yellow suit. This follows a complementary color scheme. Blue and yellow sit opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a nice, unique balance. This type of scheme is great for catching the eye while maintaining a sense of cohesion and calm. The yellow suit pops against the blue background, but in a way that feels less confrontational than the clash of red, green, and blue in the first poster.\\n\\nIn UI design, complementary colors can help create emphasis without overwhelming the user. A blue interface with strategically placed yellow elements\u2014buttons, icons, or text would be a good idea. It\u2019s like giving them visual cues without shouting.\\n\\nMy posters will be a reminder of how different color schemes evoke different emotions. Clash schemes can create excitement, urgency, or even discomfort when needed, but must be used carefully. They\u2019re great for making something stand out, like error messages or call-to-action buttons, but too much can overwhelm users. On the other hand, complementary schemes offer contrast in a way that\u2019s pleasing to the eye. This balance is ideal for creating interfaces that feel both engaging and easy to navigate. When users are working through a complex app or website, they don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being bombarded with too much intensity. Complementary colors offer that subtle touch.\\n\\nBoth posters and both color schemes have their place. I think that the key to UI, much like in art, is knowing which tool to use at the right moment."},{"id":"/aestheticDesign","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/aestheticDesign","source":"@site/blog/aestheticDesign.md","title":"Aesthetic Design","description":"In response to Chapter 6 of Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery.

(2008). *Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery*. New Riders.*\\n\\nAfter reading about \\"The Big Four\\" design principles\u2014Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in the reading, I thought about ways these ideas are common in life that have nothing to do with screens or the internet.\\n\\nFor example: contrast. This principle is everywhere, like when picking out an outfit. Wearing a black or neutral colored dress with a red bag/accessory makes the red stand out and adds interest to the look. The reading emphasized how contrast helps important elements pop, which is the same reason why we might pair a bold accessory with a simple outfit. \\n\\nRepetition is a big part of interior design, like in the way a cozy room might have the same vibe of decor or the same color throughout the space. This creates a sense of unity, just as the book describes. \\n\\nAlignment made me think about hanging up pictures to create a \u201cgallery wall\u201d. When things are lined up intentionally, it instantly makes the space look more organized and visually pleasing. The reading pointed out how alignment brings order to a design, which is why we naturally line things up in our surroundings, it just feels right.\\n\\nLastly, proximity made me think of arranging items on a kitchen counter. We instinctively group things that go together, like coffee mugs next to the coffee maker or utensils close to the stove. The reading\u2019s point about proximity helping to show relationships between items clicked with me when I thought of how we organize our physical spaces to be more functional.\\n\\nUnderstanding these principles will definitely help in my future as a software engineer. When designing software, applying contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity can make an app\u2019s layout as cohesive as outfits or gallery walls. It\u2019s all about creating an experience that feels natural and easy to navigate, just like how we arrange things in our everyday spaces.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/redBag.jpeg)"},{"id":"/designRules","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designRules","source":"@site/blog/designRules.md","title":"Design Rules","description":"In response to Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of: Krug, S.

New Riders.*\\n\\nScanning and Satisficing from Chapter 2 emphasize that users don\u2019t consume information in a linear way, or read everything. This is why Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) and the use of Conventions are important. If a website or app follows established patterns, it makes it easier for users to look through and find what they need.\\n\\nThe relationship between Navigation Clarity (Chapter 4) and Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) is crucial. A well-designed hierarchy can improve navigation by highlighting what\'s important and where users need to go (e.g., having breadcrumbs). Together, these help users feel in control and avoid getting lost.\\n\\nMinimizing unnecessary text (Chapter 5) works hand-in-hand with reducing visual noise (Chapter 3). This combination helps reduce cognitive load, making it easier for users to process content quickly without being overwhelmed. Clickability from Chapter 3 also ties into this, as clear, concise instructions should guide users to the right actions.\\n\\nAcross all chapters, Krug reinforces that the core focus should always be usability, whether through simplifying text, improving navigation, or designing with conventions in mind. Each chapter adds another layer to this, highlighting that the easier we make it for users, the more successful the product will be.\\n\\nUnderstanding these relationships is important to create user-friendly apps/websites. By internalizing how users think and interact with digital products, I\'ll be able to design solutions that reduce frustration, improve engagement, and lead to better overall satisfaction. Whether I\'m developing a database or designing a feature in my future software engineering work, these ideas will be helpful while trying to create intuitive, effective solutions.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/hierarchy.jpeg)"},{"id":"/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","source":"@site/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg.md","title":"Schneiderman & Info Org","description":"In response to Shneiderman, B.
