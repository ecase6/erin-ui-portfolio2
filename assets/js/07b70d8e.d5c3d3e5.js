(2008). *Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery*. New Riders.*\\n\\nAfter reading about \\"The Big Four\\" design principles\u2014Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in the reading, I thought about ways these ideas are common in life that have nothing to do with screens or the internet.\\n\\nFor example: contrast. This principle is everywhere, like when picking out an outfit. Wearing a black or neutral colored dress with a red bag/accessory makes the red stand out and adds interest to the look. The reading emphasized how contrast helps important elements pop, which is the same reason why we might pair a bold accessory with a simple outfit. \\n\\nRepetition is a big part of interior design, like in the way a cozy room might have the same vibe of decor or the same color throughout the space. This creates a sense of unity, just as the book describes. \\n\\nAlignment made me think about hanging up pictures to create a \u201cgallery wall\u201d. When things are lined up intentionally, it instantly makes the space look more organized and visually pleasing. The reading pointed out how alignment brings order to a design, which is why we naturally line things up in our surroundings, it just feels right.\\n\\nLastly, proximity made me think of arranging items on a kitchen counter. We instinctively group things that go together, like coffee mugs next to the coffee maker or utensils close to the stove. The reading\u2019s point about proximity helping to show relationships between items clicked with me when I thought of how we organize our physical spaces to be more functional.\\n\\nUnderstanding these principles will definitely help in my future as a software engineer. When designing software, applying contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity can make an app\u2019s layout as cohesive as outfits or gallery walls. It\u2019s all about creating an experience that feels natural and easy to navigate, just like how we arrange things in our everyday spaces.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/redBag.jpeg)"},{"id":"/designRules","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designRules","source":"@site/blog/designRules.md","title":"Design Rules","description":"In response to Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of: Krug, S.

New Riders.*\\n\\nScanning and Satisficing from Chapter 2 emphasize that users don\u2019t consume information in a linear way, or read everything. This is why Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) and the use of Conventions are important. If a website or app follows established patterns, it makes it easier for users to look through and find what they need.\\n\\nThe relationship between Navigation Clarity (Chapter 4) and Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) is crucial. A well-designed hierarchy can improve navigation by highlighting what\'s important and where users need to go (e.g., having breadcrumbs). Together, these help users feel in control and avoid getting lost.\\n\\nMinimizing unnecessary text (Chapter 5) works hand-in-hand with reducing visual noise (Chapter 3). This combination helps reduce cognitive load, making it easier for users to process content quickly without being overwhelmed. Clickability from Chapter 3 also ties into this, as clear, concise instructions should guide users to the right actions.\\n\\nAcross all chapters, Krug reinforces that the core focus should always be usability, whether through simplifying text, improving navigation, or designing with conventions in mind. Each chapter adds another layer to this, highlighting that the easier we make it for users, the more successful the product will be.\\n\\nUnderstanding these relationships is important to create user-friendly apps/websites. By internalizing how users think and interact with digital products, I\'ll be able to design solutions that reduce frustration, improve engagement, and lead to better overall satisfaction. Whether I\'m developing a database or designing a feature in my future software engineering work, these ideas will be helpful while trying to create intuitive, effective solutions.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/hierarchy.jpeg)"},{"id":"/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg","source":"@site/blog/schneidermanAndInfoOrg.md","title":"Schneiderman & Info Org","description":"In response to Shneiderman, B.

Queens will usually start with a clear goal for challenges and runways (like embodying a specific character or theme) but sometimes things are lost between intention and execution. Just as DOET describes, they must plan, execute, and then evaluate their actions, adjusting based on feedback. The \\"Gulf of Execution\\" becomes evident when their vision doesn\u2019t fully translate into their look or performance, which demonstrates the challenges of transforming an idea into reality. \\n\\nThis reflection on the stages of action and the gap between intention and outcome shows the complex process of design, whether in drag or in design of everyday objects. I\'ll keep this in mind when I\'m designing or developing software in my future career.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/dragQueen.jpeg)"},{"id":"/affordancesAndSignifiersI","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/affordancesAndSignifiersI","source":"@site/blog/affordancesAndSignifiersI.md","title":"Affordances & Signifiers I","description":"In response to Chapter 1 of: Norman, D.A.

It\'s important to keep humans behavior, understanding, and potential error in mind. It made me think about how elderly people are often blamed for their struggles with technology, but really they\'re just human, and it\'s not their fault that it\'s difficult for them to understand. When things are poorly designed, human error is inevitable (as the author alludes to this in his experience at the American nuclear power plan accident). I\'ll definitely remember this concept going forward, as I aim to design well and not get frustrated over \\"human error\\". There will always be room to improve and create a better and more clear experience for users.\\n\\n![Error getting image](/img/computerHelp.jpg)"},{"id":"/example-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/example-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/exampleblogpost.md","title":"Example Blog Post","description":"This is an example of a blog post for a homework assignment with an assigned reading.","date":"2024-08-26T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":0.425,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Example Blog Post","slug":"/example-blog-post","date":"2024-08-26T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Affordances & Signifiers I","permalink":"/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/affordancesAndSignifiersI"}},"content":"This is an example of a blog post for a homework assignment with an assigned reading.\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
