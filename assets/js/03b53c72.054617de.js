For crafters, staying organized can make the difference between enjoying their projects and feeling overwhelmed. By making information easy to find and access, the UI helps crafters avoid wasting time, track what they have, and manage their creative process smoothly. I chose playfulness because crafting is an inherently creative process, so the app should reflect that energy.
