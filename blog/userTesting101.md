# User Testing 101
*In response to Don't Make Me Think Chapters 8 and 9*

If I had to choose one word to capture Chapter 8, it would be "Perspective". This chapter highlights how our professional and personal perspectives shape, and often complicate, our approach to usability in design. Designers, developers, marketers, and all other roles bring their own strong beliefs about what makes a great user experience. This can often clashing over details based on what matters most to them. For designers, it might be the visual aesthetic of a page, while for developers, it’s the clever and efficient functionality. And because we’re all technology users, we tend to project our preferences onto others, assuming other people want what we like.

This concept of perspective is important for me to remember in my career because it emphasizes the importance of staying open-minded. Recognizing different perspectives helps shift the focus from what I or others think users want to what users actually need. That’s where usability testing becomes essential. By stepping outside of our personal viewpoints, we can rely on user feedback to ground our designs in real-world use. This perspective shift can make decisions easier and lead to better, more user-focused designs that work for everyone.
