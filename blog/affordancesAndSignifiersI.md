# Affordances & Signifiers I
*In response to Chapter 1 of: Norman, D.A. (2013). The design of everyday things. MIT Press.*

I would summarize the section titled "Complexity of Modern Devices" with the word "human". 

**“We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.”**

This is very relevant to remember when creating software and testing, along with creating everyday products like washing machines or blenders. It's important to keep humans behavior, understanding, and potential error in mind. It made me think about how elderly people are often blamed for their struggles with technology, but really they're just human, and it's not their fault that it's difficult for them to understand. When things are poorly designed, human error is inevitable (as the author alludes to this in his experience at the American nuclear power plan accident). I'll definitely remember this concept going forward, as I aim to design well and not get frustrated over "human error". There will always be room to improve and create a better and more clear experience for users.
