# Colors II
*In response to pages 26-55 and 176-191 of: Sutton, T., & Whelan, B. M. (1998). The complete color harmony: Expert color information for professional color results. Rockport Publishers.*

Reading about the different types of color schemes at the beginning of this section of the book immediately made 
me think of the schemes that I gravitate towards. I really enjoy clash and complementary schemes, and I found examples
of both of these on posters I have hung up in my room. Not only have I seen these schemes in my posters, but I've also 
seen them in lots of other decor and even some UI.

The above poster has a mix of muted green and blue with big red letters that jump out aggressively. This is a prime example of what’s known as a clash scheme—where colors that aren't quite opposites on the color wheel create visual tension. The green and blue of the background sit comfortably together, but the red stands out. It’s bold, unexpected, and it demands attention.

In UI design, clash schemes can be powerful but intense. They demand attention. I can think of a button in an app that’s an intense color against a muted background. This kind of contrast can drive action, but it can also overwhelm the user. I think the trick would be to use clashing colors intentionally, in small amounts, to direct the user’s focus without causing discomfort or cognitive overload.

In this other poster, above, it is dominated by blue, with a man in a yellow suit. This follows a complementary color scheme. Blue and yellow sit opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a nice, unique balance. This type of scheme is great for catching the eye while maintaining a sense of cohesion and calm. The yellow suit pops against the blue background, but in a way that feels less confrontational than the clash of red, green, and blue in the first poster.

In UI design, complementary colors can help create emphasis without overwhelming the user. A blue interface with strategically placed yellow elements—buttons, icons, or text would be a good idea. It’s like giving them visual cues without shouting.

My posters will be a reminder of how different color schemes evoke different emotions. Clash schemes can create excitement, urgency, or even discomfort when needed, but must be used carefully. They’re great for making something stand out, like error messages or call-to-action buttons, but too much can overwhelm users. On the other hand, complementary schemes offer contrast in a way that’s pleasing to the eye. This balance is ideal for creating interfaces that feel both engaging and easy to navigate. When users are working through a complex app or website, they don’t want to feel like they’re being bombarded with too much intensity. Complementary colors offer that subtle touch.

Both posters and both color schemes have their place. I think that the key to UI, much like in art, is knowing which tool to use at the right moment.
