# Colors I
*In response to pages 8-25 of: Sutton, T., & Whelan, B. M. (1998). The complete color harmony: Expert color information for professional color results. Rockport Publishers.*

I thought it would be interesting to try “The Process” on page 14. 

**STEP 1:
Clearly define the results you want to achieve with color.**

I want to create something that invokes feelings of calmness, lightheartedness, ease, and playfulness. 

This step was important because it made me really think about the emotions I wanted to create, reminding me that design is not just about looks - it's about how it makes people feel.

**STEP 2:
Select a main color that reflects the needs of the project.**

I chose blue since it's often associated with calmness and peacefulness. This part helped me see how selecting a color can set the tone for an entire project, much like how a project's main goal drives design choices.

**STEP 3:
Select a color scheme based on the choice of the central hue.**

After experimenting with different palettes, I realized how much the surrounding colors can affect the mood. Blue paired with lighter, pastel tones felt lighthearted and playful, while pairing it with deeper hues added a sense of balance and seriousness.

**STEP 4:
Refine the available color choices in terms of the particular project or individual sensibility.**

I narrowed it down to three colors, which made the scheme feel more focused and simple. This step made me think about constraints. If this were a real project, I would need to consider factors like accessibility and brand identity. Simplifying the palette was a valuable exercise in making choices that align with the project's goals.

Reflection: Going through this process gave me insight into how color can shape a user's experience. In my future career as a software engineer, this will be useful when designing user interfaces. I see how important it is to start by defining the emotional goals of a project, then select colors thoughtfully to support those goals. Narrowing down a palette to just a few colors will keep the design clean and user-friendly, which is key in building intuitive software. This exercise showed me that every color choice should be intentional, creating a visual experience that reflects the project's purpose.
