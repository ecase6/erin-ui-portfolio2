# Schneiderman & Info Organization
*In response to Shneiderman, B. (1996). The eyes have it: A task by data type taxonomy for information visualizations. Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages, 336â€“343. https://doi.org/10.1109/VL.1996.545307*

The "Visual Information-Seeking Mantra" is to data as a GPS is to navigation.

Just like a GPS helps you get an overview of your surroundings, zoom into specific areas, filter out routes and provide more details when needed, the mantra ("Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand") is a guide for navigating large datasets. It helps users to gain an overall understanding, find and process relevant information, and get specific details when needed. 

This concept is important for my career because, as a software engineer, I will almost certainly at some point need to present complex or large amounts of data in an easily digestible format. Just as GPS makes traveling simpler by removing the complexity of maps, applying this mantra to visualizing/formatting data would make reviewing large datasets more manageable and efficient for users.
