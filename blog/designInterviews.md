# Design Interviews
One of the videos that I watched was called “UX/UI Interview Questions with Answers & Tips! (from a Google UX Designer)” by Ricardo Hernandez Perez, who is a UI Designer at Google. In this video, he shared some tips for interviewing for UI/UX positions, as well as some common questions that are asked. He explained that talking about the things that make you unique is powerful. I think this is good advice when interviewing for any role, as it’s good to set yourself apart from other candidates. Some of the common questions that might be asked in interviews are as follows:  

- What is your design process? 

- Walk us through a project

    - What would you have done differently?

    - What were the biggest challenges?

- Describe a situation where someone disagreed about your design

- How do you incorporate user research?

- How do you use data to inform your designs?

- How would you work on a project where there is ambiguity?

The biggest takeaway that I found from his explanation of how to answer these quesitons was that it’s helpful to have real experiences in mind. Preparing a narrative will not only help you answer the questions, but it will also help the interviewer get to know you better and understand the unique experiences you’ve had. 

While this video was specifically for UI/UX interviews, I think that a lot of the advice and main takeaways are the same for other interviews, especially software engineering interviews. While the technical questions will be different, having unique experiences and stories to share would be helpful when interviewing for that role as well.
