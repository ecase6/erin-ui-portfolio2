Answers &amp; Tips! (from a Google UX Designer)” by Ricardo Hernandez Perez, who is a UI Designer at Google. In this video, he shared some tips for interviewing for UI/UX positions, as well as some common questions that are asked. He explained that talking about the things that make you unique is powerful. I think this is good advice when interviewing for any role, as it’s good to set yourself apart from other candidates. Some of the common questions that might be asked in interviews are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is your design process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk us through a project</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What would you have done differently?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the biggest challenges?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe a situation where someone disagreed about your design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you incorporate user research?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you use data to inform your designs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you work on a project where there is ambiguity?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest takeaway that I found from his explanation of how to answer these quesitons was that it’s helpful to have real experiences in mind. Preparing a narrative will not only help you answer the questions, but it will also help the interviewer get to know you better and understand the unique experiences you’ve had.</p>
<p>While this video was specifically for UI/UX interviews, I think that a lot of the advice and main takeaways are the same for other interviews, especially software engineering interviews. While the technical questions will be different, having unique experiences and stories to share would be helpful when interviewing for that role as well.</p>

<p>When brainstorming what application I should create and design, I chose the idea that’s always been in the front of my mind: a Craft/DIY organizer. Ever since I can remember, I’ve loved creating. Knitting, sewing, painting, sculpting – you name it! I enjoy it all. I got this passion for creating from my mom, who also loves to craft and create in her free time. In fact, in my mom’s house (and my childhood home), we have a whole room dedicated to crafts and crafting materials. While this space was the source of many fond memories for the both of us, the organization of the space has always been a bit of a problem. We had so many things in there and so many opportunities that it was hard to keep track of what we had and what we wanted to create. I have always wished there was a tool to help with this problem. So, I decided to design one! I worked alone on this project to design a desktop prototype for a DIY/Craft Organization Solution, called Crafty. Ideally, this application would be available through mobile devices as well, but I decided to focus solely on a desktop application for now, as that’s what I prefer to use most of the time when I’m trying to plan/organize things. This application would not only be useful to my mom and I, but to creators all around the world, as this organizational problem I described is a common one for many people.</p>
<p>Once I decided on this idea, the next step was to think through the details: what features are important, what should it convey, what styles would be best, etc. To help work through these questions, one method I used was creating a story about a hypothetical person who would benefit from this application. A summarized version of this story is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Late at night, Paul is about to sleep when inspiration strikes: a macramé plant hanger. He’s eager to start but the excitement is followed by concern – does he have enough rope? Digging through craft bins might wake his roommates, so he turns to his craft organizer app. Opening the &quot;Materials Inventory,&quot; Paul quickly checks his supplies. The app confirms he has enough rope, saving him from a midnight search. Relieved, he logs a reminder in the &quot;Current Projects&quot; section to revisit another unfinished piece before starting this new one. Using the app’s time tracker, he estimates how long the hanger will take and sets a goal for tomorrow. Satisfied, Paul sets his laptop aside, confident his creativity is under control. Thanks to the app, he can rest easy, ready to craft stress-free in the morning.</em></p>
<p>Writing this story revealed some key things that I should keep in mind while designing the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be simple to navigate and use</li>
<li>Tracking projects, materials, time, and “due dates” are valuable</li>
<li>Having an area in the app to take quick notes is essential</li>
</ul>
<p>Another method that I used to determine the details of the app was to come up with 2 main values that the app should embody. I decided that these would be <strong>organization</strong> and <strong>playfulness</strong>. I chose organization because it’s important that users feel in control of their materials, projects, and time, all from one place. For crafters, staying organized can make the difference between enjoying their projects and feeling overwhelmed. By making information easy to find and access, the UI helps crafters avoid wasting time, track what they have, and manage their creative process smoothly. I chose playfulness because crafting is an inherently creative process, so the app should reflect that energy. It’s not just about completing tasks, it’s about making the journey enjoyable and inspiring creativity. Adding playful elements keeps the experience lighthearted and encourages users to stay engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Early Designs</strong></p>
<p>My next step was to start making some designs. The very first designs I created were by-hand, with regular-old pen and paper.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/flowchartSketch-296e28d85d15c98070c5a942d3c087a5.png" width="1398" height="770" class="img_ev3q">
The goal of the sketch above was to determine the screens/modals I would need and how they would work together for navigation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/pagesSketch-17d2e632fcc68567ecd6cca9be3698c9.png" width="950" height="1268" class="img_ev3q">
The above sketch is an example of a couple of pages/components I sketched out to get a rough idea of what the mockups might look like. These don’t include all of the details I had in mind, as it was a lot harder and more time-consuming to sketch designs by hand than I anticipated!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/firstCard-284459d916949e93200346086ce9a00d.png" width="598" height="630" class="img_ev3q">
The above screenshot is from the earliest version of Figma mockups. This was the design for a “project card” (when the user clicks on a project, this is the detailed view that would be shown).</p>
<p>A lot ended up changing from these sketches/designs to my final mockups, which you will see further below.</p>
<p>After doing some sketches, it was time to take a stab at creating a design system. This concept was something that seemed very simple and easy to me before starting, but once I started, I found it was not as simple as I would have hoped! When making a design system from scratch, there are so many choices that need to be made: colors, fonts, buttons, etc. It took me a long time to make these decisions.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/018Q63YKHEEpRSEdmZALaj/FinalProject?node-id=0-1&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Creating my Style Guide within my Design System is where I wanted to start. In this, I identified the colors, font styles, and logos I wanted to use. For the colors, I chose bright (but not too “in-your-face”) colors, that would inspire creativity. For the background color, I decided on a cream color. I chose this instead of white because I often think white strains the eyes, and I thought a cream would better complement any pictures that users choose to upload, as well as the app as a whole. I made sure that my colors all had good contrast to ensure accessibility. The font styles I chose were meant to be simple, yet fun. I made sure to choose sans-serif fonts for accessibility. I also chose grays instead of black for the font colors because it’s easier on the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Early Prototype</strong></p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/av70StQnfcSz2XkeL4pdcn/FinalProject-Prototype?node-id=2021-4333&amp;starting-point-node-id=2021%3A4333&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>The prototype above is the earliest working prototype of the application that I created. The navigation is meant to be pretty straightforward. There is a dashboard that displays some information at a glance, along with pages for projects, inventory, shopping list, calendar, and finished projects. Feel free to click around and explore!</p>
<p>After creating this prototype, I had a colleague look at it and give me some feedback. A strength that was identified during this was that the prototype was simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate. I was glad to hear this, as this was an important goal of mine. Another strength was the color scheme. My colleague liked the design system I chose and thought it matched the functionality of the application. One major weakness was that there were some inconsistencies with margins, buttons, and components. For example, it’s easy to see that the shopping list component on the dashboard doesn’t match the style of everything else. This is something I made sure to put more effort into to fix in the future. It was important to me that everything looked cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: User Tests</strong></p>
<p>I conducted a number of user tests throughout the process of creating the design of the application – some formal, and some less so. For the formal ones, I had a script that I would read to the participants, and I would ask them to explore the application as well as complete a task. For the less formal ones, I would just ask for general feedback as the user explored the application. I had a wide variety of participants do user testing with me. Some were colleagues, others were friends – all with varying levels of experience with crafting.</p>
<p>Some common feedback I got during user testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users enjoyed the colors and styling</li>
<li>Users thought the purpose of the app was clear</li>
<li>Users thought the app was easy to navigate</li>
<li>Users didn’t get the “whole image” of the app, as not every feature is interactive/implemented (this is to be expected, as actually developing the app was not the purpose of the project)</li>
<li>Some users found the differences in margins/spacing distracting or not as clean as it could be</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific usability issues I committed to changing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shopping list cards didn’t match the style of the others</li>
</ul>
<p>Design consistency plays a big role in user experience because it makes the user more comfortable and eases navigation within the app. When the shopping list cards don’t match the style of other elements, it can distract or confuse users. I fixed this by making these cards more similar to the rest (matching border radius, drop shadow, font, size, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li>The calendar looks off</li>
</ul>
<p>The calendar is important for visualizing timelines and deadlines. A wonky layout makes it harder for users to read and navigate, which could lead to missed deadlines or scheduling errors. I made this fix by creating my own calendar in Figma, rather than using one that was pre-built. I used the pre-made one at first to save time, but I decided taking the time to make my own would be necessary and worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no interface for the filter/sort buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without an interface for filter and sort options, users are limited in their ability to manage projects efficiently, especially as their list of projects gets bigger. Filter and sort are essential for usability, and it would allow users to quickly locate specific projects. I fixed this by creating an interface and adding it to my prototype in the places it needed to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to have a “project type” field (e.g., sewing) for the projects so that the user could filter/sort by that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including a “project type” field (e.g., sewing, painting) provides a way to categorize projects, making it easier for users to filter by type. This feature would be particularly useful for users who create multiple kinds of projects, helping them to organize and look at projects without unnecessary scrolling or searching. I fixed this by adding a dropdown to the project card that allows the user to add the type of project. I also made this something the user could filter by.</p>
<ul>
<li>The margins/spacing is not always consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistency in margins and spacing is important for visual hierarchy, readability, and aesthetic appeal. Inconsistent spacing can look disjointed or unprofessional. Correcting this will make the app look polished and cohesive. I fixed this by going through all of my pages and making the margins and spacing more consistent.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to have a space for more notes on a project once that project has been completed (e.g., what to do differently next time).</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing users to add notes to completed projects supports continuous learning and improvement in DIY/craft projects. This feature would enable users to reflect on what worked well and note any changes for future reference. I fixed this by adding a space to add notes to a finished project card.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5: Final Design</strong></p>
<p>The following embedded prototype is the final version of the application I created, complete with the fixes above.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/ApO4bf22i7H0JIClbw3GXG/Prototype-4?node-id=10013-7923&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>As stated previously, the two values I deemed most important for this app were <strong>organization</strong> and <strong>playfulness</strong>. I believe this final version of the app embodies those values. It is straightforward, simple, and easy to use and navigate. It is also colorful and fun, and it allows the user to be creative and playful by uploading images, typing descriptions, and adding notes.</p>
<p>I had such a fun time creating these mockups and prototypes. I wish I had more time to perfect and improve it. I would have loved to create more playful components, like snackbars, animations, and fun copy text if I had more time. I would’ve also liked to replace the gray image placeholders with real images – so people could better see the vision and potential of the app.</p>
<p>All in all, I learned a lot about UI/UX through this project, and I’m thankful to all of the people who helped me along the way.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/inclusiveDesign1">Inclusive Design 1</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-29T15:30:00.000Z">October 29, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><em>In response to Don&#x27;t Make Me Think Chapter 12 by Steve Krug</em></p>
<p>While reading this chapter I thought about how accessibility shouldn&#x27;t just be a nice-to-have, it should be treated like a non-negotiable. Making a website or app accessible isn&#x27;t just about following a set of rules, it’s about designing for people. And even if those people aren&#x27;t standing right in front of us, their needs are real and valid.</p>
<p>Krug hit on something powerful when they said, “it’s profoundly the right thing to do.” Accessibility isn&#x27;t just about covering a legal requirement or making a site &quot;usable&quot; for most people, it&#x27;s about asking ourselves what we owe to those who need our technology the most. Every small change we make for accessibility has the power to dramatically improve someone’s experience.</p>
<p>In class and at work, it&#x27;s common to often hear about creating &quot;good design&quot; or “user-centered design,” but it’s easy to forget who “the user” is when we&#x27;re rushing to meet deadlines or cramming features into limited time. Accessibility teaches us to slow down and think more broadly about who we’re designing for and to remember that every user is a real person with unique needs and perspectives. This reminder feels crucial as I step into the tech industry. I want to create something that everyone can use.</p>
<p>This chapter also gave me some practical takeaways I can use right away, like adding alt text to images and using semantic HTML structures. Accessibility might take a bit of extra time and might not show up as “cool” or “fancy” in the design itself, but it’s the kind of work that makes a real difference in people’s lives.</p>

<p>Reading about how we approach using something completely unfamiliar, I thought about the way we rely on two distinct kinds of knowledge: what’s in the world around us and what’s in our heads.</p>
<p>The chapter explained how physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints help us make decisions. These constraints are like silent guides, reducing the chances of making mistakes by narrowing down the set of possible actions. When we combine these with the mental models we’ve built over time, we can operate complex or unfamiliar objects surprisingly easy.</p>
<p>What really sticks with me is the balance between design and our natural ability to adapt. As a future developer, I want to think about both the external and internal ways people make sense of what I create. It’s not just about coding something that works, it’s about designing in a way that guides users effortlessly through the experience. This approach doesn’t just make things easier to use, it makes them feel intuitive.</p>
<p>This kind of knowledge is like learning a new language that we can &quot;read&quot; without words, just by looking at a well-designed object or interface. The world is full of signals, and learning to interpret them (or create them, in my case) is both an art and a science.</p>

<p>On these pages, Krug talks about what usually goes wrong during user testing, and more importantly, how to fix it. It turns out most of the issues are simpler than we&#x27;d imagine. Some include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users don’t get it. Sometimes, people just look at your site and are completely lost. Either they can’t figure out what it’s for, or they think they know and they’re totally wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can’t find the right words. They’re searching for something, but the words on your site don’t match what they’d expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much clutter. Ever had what you need right in front of you but you just couldn’t see it? That happens to users too. When there’s too much going on, people can miss what’s important. Sometimes the solution is to simplify the page or make key elements stand out more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each round of testing, Krug recommends a quick debrief, ideally over pizza, to decide what needs fixing. The idea is to focus on the biggest problems first and avoid getting distracted by minor things. Here’s his approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>List the top issues. Go around the room and have everyone share what they saw as the three biggest problems. Write them down—no discussion yet, just listing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize. Once you’ve got the list, pick the ten most important problems and rank them from worst to least urgent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a plan. For each of the top problems, figure out how you’ll fix it, who will handle it, and what resources they’ll need. The goal isn’t to fix every problem perfectly, but to make enough progress that the big issues are no longer deal-breakers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Krug’s advice is also to resist the urge to add more stuff when users are confused. Instead of piling on explanations, sometimes the best solution is to take things away and make the page simpler. And if a user suggests a new feature, take it with a grain of salt because they’ll often realize that they wouldn’t even use it themselves.</p>

<p>In Chapter 7 of Don’t Make Me Think, Krug highlights the importance of a seamless and intuitive user experience. One of the main takeaways is the concept of &quot;the first law of usability,&quot; which states that a user interface should be self-evident. This means that users shouldn’t have to think too much to understand how something works; they should be able to glance at a webpage or an app and know immediately what to do. This principle is central to creating effective digital experiences because it reduces cognitive load and frustration. This allows users to focus on their goals rather than trying to figure out confusing navigation or design elements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Presentation Zen (Chapters 2 and 4) by Reynolds focuses on effective presentation design, with an emphasis on simplicity and storytelling. In Chapter 2, Reynolds introduces the idea of &quot;restraint&quot; in design, using only what is necessary to convey your message without overwhelming your audience with excessive text, data, etc. Chapter 4 expands on this by discussing the importance of visual clarity and the power of storytelling. A compelling narrative paired with clean, minimal slides can make presentations more engaging.</p>
<p>When we merge these ideas from both books, the ideas of simplicity, clarity, and engagement are apparent, whether you&#x27;re designing a user interface or delivering a presentation. In both cases, the goal is to guide your audience without distracting or confusing them. Just as Krug advises designers to create user interfaces that don&#x27;t require thought, Reynolds advises presenters to strip away unnecessary clutter so that the core message stands out.</p>
<p>As someone working in software development, these lessons are incredibly relevant. Whether I’m collaborating on a UI project or preparing a presentation, balancing simplicity and engagement will be important. In user interface design, I’ve learned that every additional button, menu, or piece of text is a potential point of confusion for the user. The more straightforward the interface, the easier it will be for the user to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>This piece does a good job at demonstrating how each of the portfolios are unique and show off the designer&#x27;s individuality, but still manages to be consistent and easy to use. Each designer has their own style, creativity, and perspective, which helps communicate who they are and what they&#x27;re all about. Even though the designs are different, they all follow good usability practices, making it easy for viewers to navigate and understand the content.</p>
<p>This balance between individuality and consistency is very important for UX portfolios. It lets designers express their unique approach while making sure the portfolio is still accessible and user-friendly. Consistent navigation, typography, and structure create a familiar experience for viewers, while unique visual elements, color schemes, and personal touches make the portfolio stand out and be memorable.</p>
<p>For my career, I think it&#x27;s important to remember that a good portfolio isn&#x27;t just about showing off creativity, it&#x27;s also about making sure the user experience is smooth and easy. By combining both individuality and consistency, I can create a portfolio that not only grabs attention but also communicates my design skills and thought process effectively.</p>

<p>The art piece I found inspiration in is Hot Dog Bridge by Russell T. Gordon. This is a six-color lithograph created in 1974 and is part of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln&#x27;s collection, gifted by Dr. Christopher and Janet Graf. Gordon, an American artist, was born in Philadelphia in 1936 and later passed in Montreal in 2013. The artwork portrays a surreal scene where a hot dog stretches across two canyon-like formations, set against a vivid background featuring a bright blue sky, white clouds, and a rainbow. This whimsical combination of elements evokes nostalgia, inviting viewers to embrace humor and lightheartedness during challenging times.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Color Balance</li>
</ol>
<p>The vibrant color palette used in Hot Dog Bridge immediately grabs attention. The contrast between the bright blue sky, the bold rainbow, and the warm tones of the rocks creates a balanced and dynamic visual experience. The hot dog, an iconic and familiar object, stands out against the surreal background and magnifies the humor in the piece. The combination of these bold and simplified colors creates a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Joseph Albers’ Interaction of Color, which discusses the importance of contrast in evoking emotion through colors.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Surrealism and Humor</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance, the piece&#x27;s absurdity is what draws you in. A hot dog spanning a canyon is not a typical sight. This constract between reality and imagination is central to surrealism. It encourages people to find meaning in the nonsensical, which is exactly what happened for me while viewing this piece. The surreal nature of the work, paired with its lighthearted humor, represents a comforting escape from ther seriousness and challenges of the &quot;real-world&quot;.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Salvador Dalí’s works, which often use juxtaposition to inspire thought beyond the obvious.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Simplicity of Forms</li>
</ol>
<p>Gordon&#x27;s use of clean, simplified shapes, like geometric clouds, smooth curves of the hot dog, and blocky rocks creates a unified look that is easy to process visually. Despite the bizarre concept, the clarity and simplicity of the forms make it accessible to viewers. This is a prime example of how minimalistic design choices can strengthen the overall impact of a surreal composition, allowing each element to stand out clearly.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s Point and Line to Plane, which offers insights into how basic forms and geometry influence perception in art.</em></p>
<p><strong>UI Sketch</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/hotdogUISketch-c34a84bc1f5379c13d755a73ca557c45.jpg" width="2302" height="2615" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This hand-drawn sketch above represents a mobile app screen. The inspiration behind this idea was the way that I open up my notes app nearly every day to make quick to-do lists, often with only a couple of items. I thought it would be much more fun if my lists were more whimsy and playful, like this piece of art. So, the main functionality is a simple todo list, where the user drags the hot dog across the canyon once they complete a task, symbolizing the &quot;bridge&quot; of completing a task. So, the hot dog would start short and end up quite long.</p>
<p>I felt that displaying a hand-drawn sketch alone would not capture everything I was inspired by. Color, whim, surrealism, and humor were main aspects of my inspiration, so I did a quick design on Canva to try to convey the playful vibe I wanted to display, as color is very important to my thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Through this process, I’ve learned how surrealist art can inspire UI design by embracing imagination and playfulness, even in something as simple and mundane as a to-do app. Using bold colors and simplifying forms allows a balance between creative inspiration and accessibility, making interfaces both functional and delightful.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorStudy">Color Study</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-26T15:30:00.000Z">September 26, 2024</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>Drink Half Past</em> website has a UI that stands out to me, and I&#x27;d like to take some time to study it and
experiment with the colors on the page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/drinkHalfPast-9f9ecde9b6e701ff88334d0b144d8096.png" width="2870" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The original color scheme in the screenshot primarily uses pastel shades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pink (Grapefruit with Rosemary)</li>
<li>Peachy orange (Ginger with Turmeric)</li>
<li>Soft green (Spicy Lime)</li>
<li>Light yellow (Pineapple with Clove)
These background colors are similar to the colors of the cans.</li>
</ul>
<p>The buttons at the bottom of each drink card are variations of green, blue, and purple (the same color as the labels on the can). The text is mainly black, with the product names using bold, block-like fonts in dark contrasting colors, making them stand out clearly.</p>
<p>This color scheme fits into a split complementary color scheme. Pastel shades of pink, green, yellow, and peach provide soft, harmonious contrasts while the bold colors of the text and cans create focal points. The color choices also feel fresh and organic, matching the natural, vibrant qualities the brand wants to communicate.</p>
<p>The designers seem to be going for a clean, fresh, and somewhat playful mood. The pastel tones feel light and refreshing, suggesting the natural flavors/ingredients in the drinks. The bold product names give an energetic vibe, helping to reinforce the feeling of excitement and adventure in trying new flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation 1: Light Blue Monochromatic Scheme</strong>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/halfPastUI1-db71ad4638a1b1e1c7547d305bd6fb8b.png" width="960" height="720" class="img_ev3q">
This version features soft, pastel-like blue tones across the entire design. The background of each flavor card uses light shades of blue with different levels of saturation, while the buttons and text follow a similar light color scheme.
It gives a calm, clean, and refreshing feel. The light blue tones evoke a sense of trust and reliability, making the design feel professional and safe. Its cool tones imply cooling and refreshing factors in the beverage. However, the lack of strong contrast between product cards might make it harder to differentiate between flavors at a glance. While it’s visually cohesive, it could feel a bit monotonous for users seeking variety in the product options.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation 2: Earthy Analogous Scheme</strong>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/halfPastUI2-8bd7d8e3c86b1c2aba8da98b22e6b49f.png" width="960" height="720" class="img_ev3q">
This version uses a palette of greens and yellows. Each card features either a light yellow or green background, with slightly darker buttons to contrast. The analogous colors (adjacent on the color wheel) create a natural, harmonious vibe. This design has a very organic, earthy feel, which reflects the idea of natural ingredients and freshness. The yellow and green tones make it feel health-conscious and environmentally friendly. The analogous colors work well together, creating a balanced and cohesive look without clashing. This version is effective in emphasizing the natural qualities of the products but might lack the visual &quot;pop&quot; needed to grab users&#x27; attention quickly. It’s subtle and pleasing, but not as exciting as other schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation 3: High-Contrast Complementary Scheme</strong>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/halfPastUI3-344144ffd9e4a3074bbe4fdd0c1a9059.png" width="960" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this version, bright orange backgrounds are paired with blue accents for a bold, complementary color scheme. The contrast is striking, and the colors create a strong visual division between product sections. The orange and blue combination conveys energy, excitement, and urgency. This high-contrast scheme draws immediate attention and creates a dynamic, lively feel. It could be particularly effective in grabbing the attention of users who are quickly browsing the page. The complementary scheme is highly effective in making the UI engaging and attention-grabbing. However, the intensity of the colors may feel a bit overwhelming to some users, especially if they&#x27;re used to more neutral designs. Still, for an energetic, adventurous brand, this could work very well.</p>
<p><strong>Recreation 4: Triadic Scheme</strong>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/halfPastUI4-624e7225e0057f6abc0aa73a7ee1176e.png" width="960" height="720" class="img_ev3q">
The triadic scheme features a balance between purple, green, and yellow. Each product card has one of these three colors in a light, pastel tone, and the buttons use muted versions of the same colors to keep the palette consistent. This design feels playful and creative. The triadic color scheme keeps the page dynamic without the high tension of a complementary scheme. The colors are bright but not overpowering, giving a sense of fun and variety while maintaining balance. This scheme is effective in creating visual interest without overwhelming the user. It strikes a balance between contrast and harmony, making it one of the most engaging versions. It allows each product to stand out while still keeping a unified design. It could appeal to users looking for a fun, energetic brand experience.</p>
<p>Each color scheme has its strengths, but the Triadic Scheme (4) stands out as the most effective overall for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Variety/Balance: The triadic scheme offers visual variety while maintaining balance. It provides contrast without overwhelming the user, making the UI both dynamic and visually interesting.</p>
<p>Mood: The playful, vibrant tones fit the personality of a brand that sells unique and exciting beverages. It appeals to users&#x27; sense of curiosity and fun.</p>
<p>Functionality: The differentiation between each product card is clear, making it easy for users to distinguish between flavors while still feeling like the entire page is cohesive.</p>
<p>This scheme would likely be the most engaging for users while maintaining the product’s fresh and lively feel. It is the most similar to the original design, which I think is really great UI. In my version, though, I leaned into the triadic design more. However, this doesn&#x27;t reflect the flavors as well as the original does.</p>
<p>While I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most effective, I did love the boldness and edginess of Recreation 3. Everyone has their own opinions and taste!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/colorsI">Colors I</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-26T15:30:00.000Z">September 26, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><em>In response to pages 8-25 of: Sutton, T., &amp; Whelan, B. M. (1998). The complete color harmony: Expert color information for professional color results. Rockport Publishers.</em></p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to try “The Process” on page 14.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:
Clearly define the results you want to achieve with color.</strong></p>
<p>I want to create something that invokes feelings of calmness, lightheartedness, ease, and playfulness.</p>
<p>This step was important because it made me really think about the emotions I wanted to create, reminding me that design is not just about looks - it&#x27;s about how it makes people feel.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2:
Select a main color that reflects the needs of the project.</strong></p>
<p>I chose blue since it&#x27;s often associated with calmness and peacefulness. This part helped me see how selecting a color can set the tone for an entire project, much like how a project&#x27;s main goal drives design choices.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3:
Select a color scheme based on the choice of the central hue.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/blue-d429d92635b27383ec1552e55cda2283.png" width="856" height="248" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>After experimenting with different palettes, I realized how much the surrounding colors can affect the mood. Blue paired with lighter, pastel tones felt lighthearted and playful, while pairing it with deeper hues added a sense of balance and seriousness.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4:
Refine the available color choices in terms of the particular project or individual sensibility.</strong></p>
<p>I narrowed it down to three colors, which made the scheme feel more focused and simple. This step made me think about constraints. If this were a real project, I would need to consider factors like accessibility and brand identity. Simplifying the palette was a valuable exercise in making choices that align with the project&#x27;s goals.</p>

<p>Reflection: Going through this process gave me insight into how color can shape a user&#x27;s experience. In my future career as a software engineer, this will be useful when designing user interfaces. I see how important it is to start by defining the emotional goals of a project, then select colors thoughtfully to support those goals. Narrowing down a palette to just a few colors will keep the design clean and user-friendly, which is key in building intuitive software. This exercise showed me that every color choice should be intentional, creating a visual experience that reflects the project&#x27;s purpose.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">About Me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/ecase6/erin-ui-portfolio2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My UI Portfolio.
