# Aesthetic Design
*In response to Chapter 6 of: Reynolds, G. (2008). *Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery*. New Riders.*

After reading about "The Big Four" design principles—Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in the reading, I thought about ways these ideas are common in life that have nothing to do with screens or the internet.

For example: contrast. This principle is everywhere, like when picking out an outfit. Wearing a black or neutral colored dress with a red bag/accessory makes the red stand out and adds interest to the look. The reading emphasized how contrast helps important elements pop, which is the same reason why we might pair a bold accessory with a simple outfit. 

Repetition is a big part of interior design, like in the way a cozy room might have the same vibe of decor or the same color throughout the space. This creates a sense of unity, just as the book describes. 

Alignment made me think about hanging up pictures to create a “gallery wall”. When things are lined up intentionally, it instantly makes the space look more organized and visually pleasing. The reading pointed out how alignment brings order to a design, which is why we naturally line things up in our surroundings, it just feels right.

Lastly, proximity made me think of arranging items on a kitchen counter. We instinctively group things that go together, like coffee mugs next to the coffee maker or utensils close to the stove. The reading’s point about proximity helping to show relationships between items clicked with me when I thought of how we organize our physical spaces to be more functional.

Understanding these principles will definitely help in my future as a software engineer. When designing software, applying contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity can make an app’s layout as cohesive as outfits or gallery walls. It’s all about creating an experience that feels natural and easy to navigate, just like how we arrange things in our everyday spaces.
