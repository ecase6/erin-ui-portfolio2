<p>I thought it would be interesting to try “The Process” on page 14.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:
Clearly define the results you want to achieve with color.</strong></p>
<p>I want to create something that invokes feelings of calmness, lightheartedness, ease, and playfulness.</p>
<p>This step was important because it made me really think about the emotions I wanted to create, reminding me that design is not just about looks - it's about how it makes people feel.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2:
Select a main color that reflects the needs of the project.</strong></p>
<p>I chose blue since it's often associated with calmness and peacefulness. This part helped me see how selecting a color can set the tone for an entire project, much like how a project's main goal drives design choices.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3:
Select a color scheme based on the choice of the central hue.</strong></p>

<p>After experimenting with different palettes, I realized how much the surrounding colors can affect the mood. Blue paired with lighter, pastel tones felt lighthearted and playful, while pairing it with deeper hues added a sense of balance and seriousness.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4:
Refine the available color choices in terms of the particular project or individual sensibility.</strong></p>
<p>I narrowed it down to three colors, which made the scheme feel more focused and simple. This step made me think about constraints. If this were a real project, I would need to consider factors like accessibility and brand identity. Simplifying the palette was a valuable exercise in making choices that align with the project's goals.</p>

<p>Reflection: Going through this process gave me insight into how color can shape a user's experience. In my future career as a software engineer, this will be useful when designing user interfaces. I see how important it is to start by defining the emotional goals of a project, then select colors thoughtfully to support those goals. Narrowing down a palette to just a few colors will keep the design clean and user-friendly, which is key in building intuitive software. This exercise showed me that every color choice should be intentional, creating a visual experience that reflects the project's purpose.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to pages 26-55 and 176-191 of Expert color information for professional color results. Rockport Publishers.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to pages 26-55 and 176-191 of: Sutton, T., &amp; Whelan, B. M. (1998). The complete color harmony: Expert color information for professional color results. Rockport Publishers.</em></p>
<p>Reading about the different types of color schemes at the beginning of this section of the book immediately made
me think of the schemes that I gravitate towards. I really enjoy clash and complementary schemes, and I found examples
of both of these on posters I have hung up in my room. Not only have I seen these schemes in my posters, but I've also
seen them in lots of other decor and even some UI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="https://ecase6.github.io/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/3colors-e64e771e9e802f9f15be48b07121bd7f.png" width="2298" height="534" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The above poster has a mix of green and blue with big red letters that jump out aggressively. This is a prime example of what’s known as a clash scheme—where colors that aren't quite opposites on the color wheel create visual tension. The green and blue of the background sit comfortably together, but the red stands out. It’s bold, unexpected, and it demands attention.</p>
<p>In UI design, clash schemes can be powerful but intense. They demand attention. I can think of a button in an app that’s an intense color against a muted background. This kind of contrast can drive action, but it can also overwhelm the user. I think the trick would be to use clashing colors intentionally, in small amounts, to direct the user’s focus without causing discomfort or cognitive overload.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="https://ecase6.github.io/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/3colors-e64e771e9e802f9f15be48b07121bd7f.png" width="2298" height="534" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this other poster, above, it is dominated by blue, with a man in a yellow suit. This follows a complementary color scheme. Blue and yellow sit opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a nice, unique balance. This type of scheme is great for catching the eye while maintaining a sense of cohesion and calm. The yellow suit pops against the blue background, but in a way that feels less confrontational than the clash of red, green, and blue in the first poster.</p>
<p>In UI design, complementary colors can help create emphasis without overwhelming the user. A blue interface with strategically placed yellow elements—buttons, icons, or text would be a good idea. It’s like giving them visual cues without shouting.</p>
<p>My posters will be a reminder of how different color schemes evoke different emotions. Clash schemes can create excitement, urgency, or even discomfort when needed, but must be used carefully. They’re great for making something stand out, like error messages or call-to-action buttons, but too much can overwhelm users. On the other hand, complementary schemes offer contrast in a way that’s pleasing to the eye. This balance is ideal for creating interfaces that feel both engaging and easy to navigate. When users are working through a complex app or website, they don’t want to feel like they’re being bombarded with too much intensity. Complementary colors offer that subtle touch.</p>
<p>Both posters and both color schemes have their place. I think that the key to UI, much like in art, is knowing which tool to use at the right moment.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to Chapter 6 of Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery. New Riders.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to Chapter 6 of: Reynolds, G. (2008). <em>Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery</em>. New Riders.</em></p>
<p>After reading about "The Big Four" design principles—Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in the reading, I thought about ways these ideas are common in life that have nothing to do with screens or the internet.</p>
<p>For example: contrast. This principle is everywhere, like when picking out an outfit. Wearing a black or neutral colored dress with a red bag/accessory makes the red stand out and adds interest to the look. The reading emphasized how contrast helps important elements pop, which is the same reason why we might pair a bold accessory with a simple outfit.</p>
<p>Repetition is a big part of interior design, like in the way a cozy room might have the same vibe of decor or the same color throughout the space. This creates a sense of unity, just as the book describes.</p>
<p>Alignment made me think about hanging up pictures to create a “gallery wall”. When things are lined up intentionally, it instantly makes the space look more organized and visually pleasing. The reading pointed out how alignment brings order to a design, which is why we naturally line things up in our surroundings, it just feels right.</p>
<p>Lastly, proximity made me think of arranging items on a kitchen counter. We instinctively group things that go together, like coffee mugs next to the coffee maker or utensils close to the stove. The reading’s point about proximity helping to show relationships between items clicked with me when I thought of how we organize our physical spaces to be more functional.</p>
<p>Understanding these principles will definitely help in my future as a software engineer. When designing software, applying contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity can make an app’s layout as cohesive as outfits or gallery walls. It’s all about creating an experience that feels natural and easy to navigate, just like how we arrange things in our everyday spaces.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of: Krug, S. (2006). Don't make me think! A common sense approach to web usability (2nd ed.). New Riders.</em></p>
<p>Scanning and Satisficing from Chapter 2 emphasize that users don’t consume information in a linear way, or read everything. This is why Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) and the use of Conventions are important. If a website or app follows established patterns, it makes it easier for users to look through and find what they need.</p>
<p>The relationship between Navigation Clarity (Chapter 4) and Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) is crucial. A well-designed hierarchy can improve navigation by highlighting what's important and where users need to go (e.g., having breadcrumbs). Together, these help users feel in control and avoid getting lost.</p>
<p>Minimizing unnecessary text (Chapter 5) works hand-in-hand with reducing visual noise (Chapter 3). This combination helps reduce cognitive load, making it easier for users to process content quickly without being overwhelmed. Clickability from Chapter 3 also ties into this, as clear, concise instructions should guide users to the right actions.</p>
<p>Across all chapters, Krug reinforces that the core focus should always be usability, whether through simplifying text, improving navigation, or designing with conventions in mind. Each chapter adds another layer to this, highlighting that the easier we make it for users, the more successful the product will be.</p>
<p>Understanding these relationships is important to create user-friendly apps/websites. By internalizing how users think and interact with digital products, I'll be able to design solutions that reduce frustration, improve engagement, and lead to better overall satisfaction. Whether I'm developing a database or designing a feature in my future software engineering work, these ideas will be helpful while trying to create intuitive, effective solutions.</p>

<p>The "Visual Information-Seeking Mantra" is to data as a GPS is to navigation.</p>
<p>Just like a GPS helps you get an overview of your surroundings, zoom into specific areas, filter out routes and provide more details when needed, the mantra ("Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand") is a guide for navigating large datasets. It helps users to gain an overall understanding, find and process relevant information, and get specific details when needed.</p>
<p>This concept is important for my career because, as a software engineer, I will almost certainly at some point need to present complex or large amounts of data in an easily digestible format. Just as GPS makes traveling simpler by removing the complexity of maps, applying this mantra to visualizing/formatting data would make reviewing large datasets more manageable and efficient for users.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to Chapter 2 of: Norman, D.A. (2013). The design of everyday things. MIT Press.</em></p>
<p>I read Chapter 2 of DOET while having <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> on in the background, and I found there are some connections I can draw between the two.</p>
<p>The ideas of the "Gulf of Execution" and the "Seven Stages of Action" can be seen in the creative process of drag queens on RuPaul's Drag Race. Queens will usually start with a clear goal for challenges and runways (like embodying a specific character or theme) but sometimes things are lost between intention and execution. Just as DOET describes, they must plan, execute, and then evaluate their actions, adjusting based on feedback. The "Gulf of Execution" becomes evident when their vision doesn’t fully translate into their look or performance, which demonstrates the challenges of transforming an idea into reality.</p>
<p>This reflection on the stages of action and the gap between intention and outcome shows the complex process of design, whether in drag or in design of everyday objects. I'll keep this in mind when I'm designing or developing software in my future career.</p>

<p>I would summarize the section titled "Complexity of Modern Devices" with the word "human".</p>
<p><strong>“We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.”</strong></p>
<p>This is very relevant to remember when creating software and testing, along with creating everyday products like washing machines or blenders. It's important to keep humans behavior, understanding, and potential error in mind. It made me think about how elderly people are often blamed for their struggles with technology, but really they're just human, and it's not their fault that it's difficult for them to understand. When things are poorly designed, human error is inevitable (as the author alludes to this in his experience at the American nuclear power plan accident). I'll definitely remember this concept going forward, as I aim to design well and not get frustrated over "human error". There will always be room to improve and create a better and more clear experience for users.</p>
