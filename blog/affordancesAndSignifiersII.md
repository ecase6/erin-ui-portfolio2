# Affordances & Signifiers II
*In response to Chapter 2 of: Norman, D.A. (2013). The design of everyday things. MIT Press.*

I read Chapter 2 of DOET while having *RuPaul's Drag Race* on in the background, and I found there are some connections I can draw between the two. 

The ideas of the "Gulf of Execution" and the "Seven Stages of Action" can be seen in the creative process of drag queens on RuPaul's Drag Race. Queens will usually start with a clear goal for challenges and runways (like embodying a specific character or theme) but sometimes things are lost between intention and execution. Just as DOET describes, they must plan, execute, and then evaluate their actions, adjusting based on feedback. The "Gulf of Execution" becomes evident when their vision doesnâ€™t fully translate into their look or performance, which demonstrates the challenges of transforming an idea into reality. 

This reflection on the stages of action and the gap between intention and outcome shows the complex process of design, whether in drag or in design of everyday objects. I'll keep this in mind when I'm designing or developing software in my future career.
