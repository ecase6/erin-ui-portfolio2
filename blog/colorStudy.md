# Color Study

The *Drink Half Past* website has a UI that stands out to me, and I'd like to take some time to study it and 
experiment with the colors on the page.

The original color scheme in the screenshot primarily uses pastel shades:
- Pink (Grapefruit with Rosemary)
- Peachy orange (Ginger with Turmeric)
- Soft green (Spicy Lime)
- Light yellow (Pineapple with Clove)
These background colors are similar to the colors of the cans. 

The buttons at the bottom of each drink card are variations of green, blue, and purple (the same color as the labels on the can). The text is mainly black, with the product names using bold, block-like fonts in dark contrasting colors, making them stand out clearly.

This color scheme fits into a split complementary color scheme. Pastel shades of pink, green, yellow, and peach provide soft, harmonious contrasts while the bold colors of the text and cans create focal points. The color choices also feel fresh and organic, matching the natural, vibrant qualities the brand wants to communicate.

The designers seem to be going for a clean, fresh, and somewhat playful mood. The pastel tones feel light and refreshing, suggesting the natural flavors/ingredients in the drinks. The bold product names give an energetic vibe, helping to reinforce the feeling of excitement and adventure in trying new flavors.

**Recreation 1: Light Blue Monochromatic Scheme**

This version features soft, pastel-like blue tones across the entire design. The background of each flavor card uses light shades of blue with different levels of saturation, while the buttons and text follow a similar light color scheme.
It gives a calm, clean, and refreshing feel. The light blue tones evoke a sense of trust and reliability, making the design feel professional and safe. Its cool tones imply cooling and refreshing factors in the beverage. However, the lack of strong contrast between product cards might make it harder to differentiate between flavors at a glance. While it’s visually cohesive, it could feel a bit monotonous for users seeking variety in the product options.

**Recreation 2: Earthy Analogous Scheme**

This version uses a palette of greens and yellows. Each card features either a light yellow or green background, with slightly darker buttons to contrast. The analogous colors (adjacent on the color wheel) create a natural, harmonious vibe. This design has a very organic, earthy feel, which reflects the idea of natural ingredients and freshness. The yellow and green tones make it feel health-conscious and environmentally friendly. The analogous colors work well together, creating a balanced and cohesive look without clashing. This version is effective in emphasizing the natural qualities of the products but might lack the visual "pop" needed to grab users' attention quickly. It’s subtle and pleasing, but not as exciting as other schemes.

**Recreation 3: High-Contrast Complementary Scheme**

In this version, bright orange backgrounds are paired with blue accents for a bold, complementary color scheme. The contrast is striking, and the colors create a strong visual division between product sections. The orange and blue combination conveys energy, excitement, and urgency. This high-contrast scheme draws immediate attention and creates a dynamic, lively feel. It could be particularly effective in grabbing the attention of users who are quickly browsing the page. The complementary scheme is highly effective in making the UI engaging and attention-grabbing. However, the intensity of the colors may feel a bit overwhelming to some users, especially if they're used to more neutral designs. Still, for an energetic, adventurous brand, this could work very well.

**Recreation 4: Triadic Scheme**

The triadic scheme features a balance between purple, green, and yellow. Each product card has one of these three colors in a light, pastel tone, and the buttons use muted versions of the same colors to keep the palette consistent. This design feels playful and creative. The triadic color scheme keeps the page dynamic without the high tension of a complementary scheme. The colors are bright but not overpowering, giving a sense of fun and variety while maintaining balance. This scheme is effective in creating visual interest without overwhelming the user. It strikes a balance between contrast and harmony, making it one of the most engaging versions. It allows each product to stand out while still keeping a unified design. It could appeal to users looking for a fun, energetic brand experience.

Each color scheme has its strengths, but the Triadic Scheme (4) stands out as the most effective overall for the following reasons: 

Variety/Balance: The triadic scheme offers visual variety while maintaining balance. It provides contrast without overwhelming the user, making the UI both dynamic and visually interesting.

Mood: The playful, vibrant tones fit the personality of a brand that sells unique and exciting beverages. It appeals to users' sense of curiosity and fun.

Functionality: The differentiation between each product card is clear, making it easy for users to distinguish between flavors while still feeling like the entire page is cohesive.

This scheme would likely be the most engaging for users while maintaining the product’s fresh and lively feel. It is the most similar to the original design, which I think is really great UI. In my version, though, I leaned into the triadic design more. However, this doesn't reflect the flavors as well as the original does. 

While I don't think it's the most effective, I did love the boldness and edginess of Recreation 3. Everyone has their own opinions and taste!
