<p><strong>Part 1: The Idea</strong></p>
<p>When brainstorming what application I should create and design, I chose the idea that’s always been in the front of my mind: a Craft/DIY organizer. Ever since I can remember, I’ve loved creating. Knitting, sewing, painting, sculpting – you name it! I enjoy it all. I got this passion for creating from my mom, who also loves to craft and create in her free time. In fact, in my mom’s house (and my childhood home), we have a whole room dedicated to crafts and crafting materials. Below is just a glimpse of it.</p>
<div class="resized-image"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/craftRoom-f02913709e70a0145d8a869ec7d3a621.png" width="552" height="744" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>
<p>While this space was the source of many fond memories for the both of us, the organization of the space has always been a bit of a problem. We had so many things in there and so many potential projects to make that it was hard to keep track of what we had and what we wanted to create. I have always wished there was a tool to help with this problem. So, I decided to design one! I worked alone on this project to design a desktop prototype for a DIY/Craft Organization Solution, called <em>Crafty</em>. Ideally, this application would be available through mobile devices as well, but I decided to focus solely on a desktop application for now, as that’s what I prefer to use most of the time when I’m trying to plan/organize things. This application would not only be useful to my mom and I, but to creators all around the world, as this organizational problem I described is a common one for many people.</p>
<p>Once I decided on this idea, the next step was to think through the details: what features are important, what should it convey, what styles would be best, etc. To help work through these questions, one method I used was creating a story about a hypothetical person who would benefit from this application. A summarized version of this story is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Late at night, Paul is about to sleep when inspiration strikes: a macramé plant hanger. He’s eager to start but the excitement is followed by concern – does he have enough rope? Digging through craft bins might wake his roommates, so he turns to his craft organizer app. Opening the &quot;Materials Inventory,&quot; Paul quickly checks his supplies. The app confirms he has enough rope, saving him from a midnight search. Relieved, he logs a reminder in the &quot;Current Projects&quot; section to revisit another unfinished piece before starting this new one. Using the app’s time tracker, he estimates how long the hanger will take and sets a goal for tomorrow. Satisfied, Paul sets his laptop aside, confident his creativity is under control. Thanks to the app, he can rest easy, ready to craft stress-free in the morning.</em></p>
<p>Writing this story revealed some key things that I should keep in mind while designing the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be simple to navigate and use</li>
<li>Tracking projects, materials, time, and “due dates” are valuable</li>
<li>Having an area in the app to take quick notes is essential</li>
</ul>
<p>Another method that I used to determine the details of the app was to come up with 2 main values that the app should embody. I decided that these would be <strong>organization</strong> and <strong>playfulness</strong>. I chose organization because it’s important that users feel in control of their materials, projects, and time, all from one place. For crafters, staying organized can make the difference between enjoying their projects and feeling overwhelmed. By making information easy to find and access, the UI helps crafters avoid wasting time, track what they have, and manage their creative process smoothly. I chose playfulness because crafting is an inherently creative process, so the app should reflect that energy. It’s not just about completing tasks, it’s about making the journey enjoyable and inspiring creativity. Adding playful elements keeps the experience lighthearted and encourages users to stay engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Early Designs</strong></p>
<p>My next step was to start making some designs. The very first designs I created were by-hand, with regular-old pen and paper.</p>
<div class="resized-image"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/flowchartSketch-296e28d85d15c98070c5a942d3c087a5.png" width="1398" height="770" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>
<p>The goal of the sketch above was to determine the screens/modals I would need and how they would work together for navigation.</p>
<div class="resized-image"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/pagesSketch-17d2e632fcc68567ecd6cca9be3698c9.png" width="950" height="1268" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>
<p>The above sketch is an example of a couple of pages/components I sketched out to get a rough idea of what the mockups might look like. These don’t include all of the details I had in mind, as it was a lot harder and more time-consuming to sketch designs by hand than I anticipated!</p>
<div class="resized-image"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/firstCard-284459d916949e93200346086ce9a00d.png" width="598" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>
<p>The above screenshot is from the earliest version of Figma mockups. This was the design for a “project card” (when the user clicks on a project, this is the detailed view that would be shown).</p>
<p>A lot ended up changing from these sketches/designs to my final mockups, which you will see further below.</p>
<p>After doing some sketches, it was time to take a stab at creating a design system. This concept was something that seemed very simple and easy to me before starting, but once I started, I found it was not as simple as I would have hoped! When making a design system from scratch, there are so many choices that need to be made: colors, fonts, buttons, etc. It took me a long time to make these decisions.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/018Q63YKHEEpRSEdmZALaj/FinalProject?node-id=0-1&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Creating my Style Guide within my Design System is where I wanted to start. In this, I identified the colors, font styles, and logos I wanted to use. For the colors, I chose bright (but not too “in-your-face”) colors, that would inspire creativity. For the background color, I decided on a cream color. I chose this instead of white because I often think white strains the eyes, and I thought a cream would better complement any pictures that users choose to upload, as well as the app as a whole. I made sure that my colors all had good contrast to ensure accessibility. The font styles I chose were meant to be simple, yet fun. I made sure to choose sans-serif fonts for accessibility. I also chose grays instead of black for the font colors because it’s easier on the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Early Prototype</strong></p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/av70StQnfcSz2XkeL4pdcn/FinalProject-Prototype?node-id=2021-4333&amp;starting-point-node-id=2021%3A4333&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>The prototype above is the earliest working prototype of the application that I created. The navigation is meant to be pretty straightforward. There is a dashboard that displays some information at a glance, along with pages for projects, inventory, shopping list, calendar, and finished projects. Feel free to click around and explore!</p>
<p>After creating this prototype, I had a colleague look at it and give me some feedback. A strength that was identified during this was that the prototype was simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate. I was glad to hear this, as this was an important goal of mine. Another strength was the color scheme. My colleague liked the design system I chose and thought it matched the functionality of the application. One major weakness was that there were some inconsistencies with margins, buttons, and components. For example, it’s easy to see that the shopping list component on the dashboard doesn’t match the style of everything else. This is something I made sure to put more effort into to fix in the future. It was important to me that everything looked cohesive.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: User Tests</strong></p>
<p>I conducted a number of user tests throughout the process of creating the design of the application – some formal, and some less so. For the formal ones, I had a script that I would read to the participants, and I would ask them to explore the application as well as complete a task. For the less formal ones, I would just ask for general feedback as the user explored the application. I had a wide variety of participants do user testing with me. Some were colleagues, others were friends – all with varying levels of experience with crafting.</p>
<p>Some common feedback I got during user testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users enjoyed the colors and styling</li>
<li>Users thought the purpose of the app was clear</li>
<li>Users thought the app was easy to navigate</li>
<li>Users didn’t get the “whole image” of the app, as not every feature is interactive/implemented (this is to be expected, as actually developing the app was not the purpose of the project)</li>
<li>Some users found the differences in margins/spacing distracting or not as clean as it could be</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific usability issues I committed to changing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shopping list cards didn’t match the style of the others</li>
</ul>
<p>Design consistency plays a big role in user experience because it makes the user more comfortable and eases navigation within the app. When the shopping list cards don’t match the style of other elements, it can distract or confuse users. I fixed this by making these cards more similar to the rest (matching border radius, drop shadow, font, size, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li>The calendar looks off</li>
</ul>
<p>The calendar is important for visualizing timelines and deadlines. A wonky layout makes it harder for users to read and navigate, which could lead to missed deadlines or scheduling errors. I made this fix by creating my own calendar in Figma, rather than using one that was pre-built. I used the pre-made one at first to save time, but I decided taking the time to make my own would be necessary and worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no interface for the filter/sort buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without an interface for filter and sort options, users are limited in their ability to manage projects efficiently, especially as their list of projects gets bigger. Filter and sort are essential for usability, and it would allow users to quickly locate specific projects. I fixed this by creating an interface and adding it to my prototype in the places it needed to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to have a “project type” field (e.g., sewing) for the projects so that the user could filter/sort by that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including a “project type” field (e.g., sewing, painting) provides a way to categorize projects, making it easier for users to filter by type. This feature would be particularly useful for users who create multiple kinds of projects, helping them to organize and look at projects without unnecessary scrolling or searching. I fixed this by adding a dropdown to the project card that allows the user to add the type of project. I also made this something the user could filter by.</p>
<ul>
<li>The margins/spacing is not always consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistency in margins and spacing is important for visual hierarchy, readability, and aesthetic appeal. Inconsistent spacing can look disjointed or unprofessional. Correcting this will make the app look polished and cohesive. I fixed this by going through all of my pages and making the margins and spacing more consistent.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to have a space for more notes on a project once that project has been completed (e.g., what to do differently next time).</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing users to add notes to completed projects supports continuous learning and improvement in DIY/craft projects. This feature would enable users to reflect on what worked well and note any changes for future reference. I fixed this by adding a space to add notes to a finished project card.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5: Final Design</strong></p>
<p>The following embedded prototype is the final version of the application I created, complete with the fixes above.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);width:800px;height:450px"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/ApO4bf22i7H0JIClbw3GXG/Prototype-4?node-id=10013-7923&amp;embed-host=share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>As stated previously, the two values I deemed most important for this app were <strong>organization</strong> and <strong>playfulness</strong>. I believe this final version of the app embodies those values. It is straightforward, simple, and easy to use and navigate. It is also colorful and fun, and it allows the user to be creative and playful by uploading images, typing descriptions, and adding notes.</p>
<p>I had such a fun time creating these mockups and prototypes. I wish I had more time to perfect and improve it. I would have loved to create more playful components, like snackbars, animations, and fun copy text if I had more time. I would’ve also liked to replace the gray image placeholders with real images – so people could better see the vision and potential of the app.</p>
<p>All in all, I learned a lot about UI/UX through this project, and I’m thankful to all of the people who helped me along the way.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/designInterviews">Design Interviews</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-12-03T15:30:00.000Z">December 3, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>One of the videos that I watched was called “UX/UI Interview Questions with Answers &amp; Tips! (from a Google UX Designer)” by Ricardo Hernandez Perez, who is a UI Designer at Google. In this video, he shared some tips for interviewing for UI/UX positions, as well as some common questions that are asked. He explained that talking about the things that make you unique is powerful. I think this is good advice when interviewing for any role, as it’s good to set yourself apart from other candidates. Some of the common questions that might be asked in interviews are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is your design process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk us through a project</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What would you have done differently?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the biggest challenges?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe a situation where someone disagreed about your design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you incorporate user research?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you use data to inform your designs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you work on a project where there is ambiguity?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest takeaway that I found from his explanation of how to answer these quesitons was that it’s helpful to have real experiences in mind. Preparing a narrative will not only help you answer the questions, but it will also help the interviewer get to know you better and understand the unique experiences you’ve had.</p>
<p>While this video was specifically for UI/UX interviews, I think that a lot of the advice and main takeaways are the same for other interviews, especially software engineering interviews. While the technical questions will be different, having unique experiences and stories to share would be helpful when interviewing for that role as well.</p>

<p>I respresented individuals with hand tremors. Some other groups that were represented were first-time voters, elderly, and individuals with visual impairments. We had to communicate with each other and work together to ensure that the needs of each population were met in some capacity.</p>
<p>To give you some more insight to the workshop, I&#x27;ll share some of the things I learned about individuals with hand tremors in regards to their UI needs. Hand tremors cause involuntary shaking of the hands, which makes clicking and interacting with websites/apps difficult and frustrating at times. Here are just a few things that would make navigiating UIs easier for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>large buttons (ideally at least 48x48px)</li>
<li>space between clickable targets (to help prevent misclicks)</li>
<li>keyboard functionality</li>
<li>reviews before submissions</li>
<li>opportunities to fix errors</li>
<li>simple layouts</li>
</ul>
<p>The negotiations were very civil and rather quiet. I think we all recognized the importance of the needs of each population, and we wanted to make sure each group was satisfied with the results. No one wanted to &quot;bulldoze&quot; the conversation and place their groups&#x27; needs above others.</p>
<p>I advocated for a number of the needs listed above. However, the one&#x27;s I placed at top priority were button size/spacing and keyboard functionality. I quickly realized that the other needs on the list were needs that other populations need and would benefit from as well, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to advocate for those. Throughout the workshop, the number of needs we could add to the &quot;pretend project backlog&quot; got smaller and smaller. So, I had to focus mostly on the needs of my population that would also benefit others.</p>
<p>One unlikely ally I had was with the person representing indivduals with anxiety. Specifically when it came to being able to prevent/fix errors as often as the user would need. I didn&#x27;t think any of the representatives were hard to convince. Everyone was understanding, and we were working together to get the best outcome for everyone.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to not be able to ensure that all of my groups&#x27; needs would be met. Prioritizing these needs was difficult because I am not a member of the group I was representing. However, I understood that in order for everyone to get the best outcome, we would all have to compromise.</p>
<p>Here are some of my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#x27;s important to not only advocate for the needs that are important to you (or the group that you&#x27;re representing), but to also recognize and advocate for the needs of others</li>
<li>Compromise is necessary to reach an outcome that is best for everyone</li>
<li>Finding allies is important to ensure that your ideas are supported</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that all of the above are applicable in any matter where teamwork is involved. This could be at work, school, etc. The best solutions are the ones that benefit <em>everyone</em>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.

<p>While reading this chapter I thought about how accessibility shouldn&#x27;t just be a nice-to-have, it should be treated like a non-negotiable. Making a website or app accessible isn&#x27;t just about following a set of rules, it’s about designing for people. And even if those people aren&#x27;t standing right in front of us, their needs are real and valid.</p>
<p>Krug hit on something powerful when they said, “it’s profoundly the right thing to do.” Accessibility isn&#x27;t just about covering a legal requirement or making a site &quot;usable&quot; for most people, it&#x27;s about asking ourselves what we owe to those who need our technology the most. Every small change we make for accessibility has the power to dramatically improve someone’s experience.</p>
<p>In class and at work, it&#x27;s common to often hear about creating &quot;good design&quot; or “user-centered design,” but it’s easy to forget who “the user” is when we&#x27;re rushing to meet deadlines or cramming features into limited time. Accessibility teaches us to slow down and think more broadly about who we’re designing for and to remember that every user is a real person with unique needs and perspectives. This reminder feels crucial as I step into the tech industry. I want to create something that everyone can use.</p>
<p>This chapter also gave me some practical takeaways I can use right away, like adding alt text to images and using semantic HTML structures. Accessibility might take a bit of extra time and might not show up as “cool” or “fancy” in the design itself, but it’s the kind of work that makes a real difference in people’s lives.</p>

<p>Reading about how we approach using something completely unfamiliar, I thought about the way we rely on two distinct kinds of knowledge: what’s in the world around us and what’s in our heads.</p>
<p>The chapter explained how physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints help us make decisions. These constraints are like silent guides, reducing the chances of making mistakes by narrowing down the set of possible actions. When we combine these with the mental models we’ve built over time, we can operate complex or unfamiliar objects surprisingly easy.</p>
<p>What really sticks with me is the balance between design and our natural ability to adapt. As a future developer, I want to think about both the external and internal ways people make sense of what I create. It’s not just about coding something that works, it’s about designing in a way that guides users effortlessly through the experience. This approach doesn’t just make things easier to use, it makes them feel intuitive.</p>
<p>This kind of knowledge is like learning a new language that we can &quot;read&quot; without words, just by looking at a well-designed object or interface. The world is full of signals, and learning to interpret them (or create them, in my case) is both an art and a science.</p>

<p>On these pages, Krug talks about what usually goes wrong during user testing, and more importantly, how to fix it. It turns out most of the issues are simpler than we&#x27;d imagine. Some include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users don’t get it. Sometimes, people just look at your site and are completely lost. Either they can’t figure out what it’s for, or they think they know and they’re totally wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can’t find the right words. They’re searching for something, but the words on your site don’t match what they’d expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much clutter. Ever had what you need right in front of you but you just couldn’t see it? That happens to users too. When there’s too much going on, people can miss what’s important. Sometimes the solution is to simplify the page or make key elements stand out more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each round of testing, Krug recommends a quick debrief, ideally over pizza, to decide what needs fixing. The idea is to focus on the biggest problems first and avoid getting distracted by minor things. Here’s his approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>List the top issues. Go around the room and have everyone share what they saw as the three biggest problems. Write them down—no discussion yet, just listing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize. Once you’ve got the list, pick the ten most important problems and rank them from worst to least urgent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a plan. For each of the top problems, figure out how you’ll fix it, who will handle it, and what resources they’ll need. The goal isn’t to fix every problem perfectly, but to make enough progress that the big issues are no longer deal-breakers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Krug’s advice is also to resist the urge to add more stuff when users are confused. Instead of piling on explanations, sometimes the best solution is to take things away and make the page simpler. And if a user suggests a new feature, take it with a grain of salt because they’ll often realize that they wouldn’t even use it themselves.</p>

<p>If I had to choose one word to capture Chapter 8, it would be &quot;Perspective&quot;. This chapter highlights how our professional and personal perspectives shape, and often complicate, our approach to usability in design. Designers, developers, marketers, and all other roles bring their own strong beliefs about what makes a great user experience. This can often clashing over details based on what matters most to them. For designers, it might be the visual aesthetic of a page, while for developers, it’s the clever and efficient functionality. And because we’re all technology users, we tend to project our preferences onto others, assuming other people want what we like.</p>
<p>This concept of perspective is important for me to remember in my career because it emphasizes the importance of staying open-minded. Recognizing different perspectives helps shift the focus from what I or others think users want to what users actually need. That’s where usability testing becomes essential. By stepping outside of our personal viewpoints, we can rely on user feedback to ground our designs in real-world use. This perspective shift can make decisions easier and lead to better, more user-focused designs that work for everyone.</p>

<p>Providing feedback to designers is like giving instructions to a chef. If you say, “Make me something delicious,” the chef has to guess what you like, and the result might not align with your expectations. However, if you’re clear and specific, the chef has the guidance needed to create something that satisfies your taste and dietary needs. Just as a chef benefits from understanding your preferences and restrictions, a designer needs actionable and detailed feedback to craft a design that matches your vision.</p>
<p>Designers, much like chefs, work with “ingredients”: color palettes, typography, layouts, user interactions, etc. These elements can be combined in lots of ways, and without guidance, a designer may produce work that doesn’t fully meet your goals or needs. Just as vague feedback leaves a chef guessing, it leaves a designer uncertain about your expectations. Precise feedback, on the other hand, empowers both the chef and the designer to make creative choices that are aligned with the intended outcome.</p>
<p>As I prepare to transition into a full-time career in software development, the importance of effective communication is becoming increasingly clear. Whether I’m collaborating with designers, other developers, or stakeholders, being able to provide meaningful feedback will be critical. When working with designers in particular, understanding how to deliver feedback that is specific, constructive, and tied to project goals can make all the difference.</p>

<p>In Chapter 7 of Don’t Make Me Think, Krug highlights the importance of a seamless and intuitive user experience. One of the main takeaways is the concept of &quot;the first law of usability,&quot; which states that a user interface should be self-evident. This means that users shouldn’t have to think too much to understand how something works; they should be able to glance at a webpage or an app and know immediately what to do. This principle is central to creating effective digital experiences because it reduces cognitive load and frustration. This allows users to focus on their goals rather than trying to figure out confusing navigation or design elements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Presentation Zen (Chapters 2 and 4) by Reynolds focuses on effective presentation design, with an emphasis on simplicity and storytelling. In Chapter 2, Reynolds introduces the idea of &quot;restraint&quot; in design, using only what is necessary to convey your message without overwhelming your audience with excessive text, data, etc. Chapter 4 expands on this by discussing the importance of visual clarity and the power of storytelling. A compelling narrative paired with clean, minimal slides can make presentations more engaging.</p>
<p>When we merge these ideas from both books, the ideas of simplicity, clarity, and engagement are apparent, whether you&#x27;re designing a user interface or delivering a presentation. In both cases, the goal is to guide your audience without distracting or confusing them. Just as Krug advises designers to create user interfaces that don&#x27;t require thought, Reynolds advises presenters to strip away unnecessary clutter so that the core message stands out.</p>
<p>As someone working in software development, these lessons are incredibly relevant. Whether I’m collaborating on a UI project or preparing a presentation, balancing simplicity and engagement will be important. In user interface design, I’ve learned that every additional button, menu, or piece of text is a potential point of confusion for the user. The more straightforward the interface, the easier it will be for the user to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>This piece does a good job at demonstrating how each of the portfolios are unique and show off the designer&#x27;s individuality, but still manages to be consistent and easy to use. Each designer has their own style, creativity, and perspective, which helps communicate who they are and what they&#x27;re all about. Even though the designs are different, they all follow good usability practices, making it easy for viewers to navigate and understand the content.</p>
<p>This balance between individuality and consistency is very important for UX portfolios. It lets designers express their unique approach while making sure the portfolio is still accessible and user-friendly. Consistent navigation, typography, and structure create a familiar experience for viewers, while unique visual elements, color schemes, and personal touches make the portfolio stand out and be memorable.</p>
<p>For my career, I think it&#x27;s important to remember that a good portfolio isn&#x27;t just about showing off creativity, it&#x27;s also about making sure the user experience is smooth and easy. By combining both individuality and consistency, I can create a portfolio that not only grabs attention but also communicates my design skills and thought process effectively.</p>
