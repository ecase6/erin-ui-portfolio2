groups of users.</p>
<p>I respresented individuals with hand tremors. Some other groups that were represented were first-time voters, elderly, and individuals with visual impairments. We had to communicate with each other and work together to ensure that the needs of each population were met in some capacity.</p>
<p>To give you some more insight to the workshop, I&#x27;ll share some of the things I learned about individuals with hand tremors in regards to their UI needs. Hand tremors cause involuntary shaking of the hands, which makes clicking and interacting with websites/apps difficult and frustrating at times. Here are just a few things that would make navigiating UIs easier for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>large buttons (ideally at least 48x48px)</li>
<li>space between clickable targets (to help prevent misclicks)</li>
<li>keyboard functionality</li>
<li>reviews before submissions</li>
<li>opportunities to fix errors</li>
<li>simple layouts</li>
</ul>
<p>The negotiations were very civil and rather quiet. I think we all recognized the importance of the needs of each population, and we wanted to make sure each group was satisfied with the results. No one wanted to &quot;bulldoze&quot; the conversation and place their groups&#x27; needs above others.</p>
<p>I advocated for a number of the needs listed above. However, the one&#x27;s I placed at top priority were button size/spacing and keyboard functionality. I quickly realized that the other needs on the list were needs that other populations need and would benefit from as well, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to advocate for those. Throughout the workshop, the number of needs we could add to the &quot;pretend project backlog&quot; got smaller and smaller. So, I had to focus mostly on the needs of my population that would also benefit others.</p>
<p>One unlikely ally I had was with the person representing indivduals with anxiety. Specifically when it came to being able to prevent/fix errors as often as the user would need. I didn&#x27;t think any of the representatives were hard to convince. Everyone was understanding, and we were working together to get the best outcome for everyone.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to not be able to ensure that all of my groups&#x27; needs would be met. Prioritizing these needs was difficult because I am not a member of the group I was representing. However, I understood that in order for everyone to get the best outcome, we would all have to compromise.</p>
<p>Here are some of my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#x27;s important to not only advocate for the needs that are important to you (or the group that you&#x27;re representing), but to also recognize and advocate for the needs of others</li>
<li>Compromise is necessary to reach an outcome that is best for everyone</li>
<li>Finding allies is important to ensure that your ideas are supported</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that all of the above are applicable in any matter where teamwork is involved. This could be at work, school, etc. The best solutions are the ones that benefit <em>everyone</em>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.

<p>While reading this chapter I thought about how accessibility shouldn&#x27;t just be a nice-to-have, it should be treated like a non-negotiable. Making a website or app accessible isn&#x27;t just about following a set of rules, it‚Äôs about designing for people. And even if those people aren&#x27;t standing right in front of us, their needs are real and valid.</p>
<p>Krug hit on something powerful when they said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs profoundly the right thing to do.‚Äù Accessibility isn&#x27;t just about covering a legal requirement or making a site &quot;usable&quot; for most people, it&#x27;s about asking ourselves what we owe to those who need our technology the most. Every small change we make for accessibility has the power to dramatically improve someone‚Äôs experience.</p>
<p>In class and at work, it&#x27;s common to often hear about creating &quot;good design&quot; or ‚Äúuser-centered design,‚Äù but it‚Äôs easy to forget who ‚Äúthe user‚Äù is when we&#x27;re rushing to meet deadlines or cramming features into limited time. Accessibility teaches us to slow down and think more broadly about who we‚Äôre designing for and to remember that every user is a real person with unique needs and perspectives. This reminder feels crucial as I step into the tech industry. I want to create something that everyone can use.</p>
<p>This chapter also gave me some practical takeaways I can use right away, like adding alt text to images and using semantic HTML structures. Accessibility might take a bit of extra time and might not show up as ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúfancy‚Äù in the design itself, but it‚Äôs the kind of work that makes a real difference in people‚Äôs lives.</p>

<p>Reading about how we approach using something completely unfamiliar, I thought about the way we rely on two distinct kinds of knowledge: what‚Äôs in the world around us and what‚Äôs in our heads.</p>
<p>The chapter explained how physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints help us make decisions. These constraints are like silent guides, reducing the chances of making mistakes by narrowing down the set of possible actions. When we combine these with the mental models we‚Äôve built over time, we can operate complex or unfamiliar objects surprisingly easy.</p>
<p>What really sticks with me is the balance between design and our natural ability to adapt. As a future developer, I want to think about both the external and internal ways people make sense of what I create. It‚Äôs not just about coding something that works, it‚Äôs about designing in a way that guides users effortlessly through the experience. This approach doesn‚Äôt just make things easier to use, it makes them feel intuitive.</p>
<p>This kind of knowledge is like learning a new language that we can &quot;read&quot; without words, just by looking at a well-designed object or interface. The world is full of signals, and learning to interpret them (or create them, in my case) is both an art and a science.</p>

<p>On these pages, Krug talks about what usually goes wrong during user testing, and more importantly, how to fix it. It turns out most of the issues are simpler than we&#x27;d imagine. Some include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users don‚Äôt get it. Sometimes, people just look at your site and are completely lost. Either they can‚Äôt figure out what it‚Äôs for, or they think they know and they‚Äôre totally wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can‚Äôt find the right words. They‚Äôre searching for something, but the words on your site don‚Äôt match what they‚Äôd expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much clutter. Ever had what you need right in front of you but you just couldn‚Äôt see it? That happens to users too. When there‚Äôs too much going on, people can miss what‚Äôs important. Sometimes the solution is to simplify the page or make key elements stand out more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each round of testing, Krug recommends a quick debrief, ideally over pizza, to decide what needs fixing. The idea is to focus on the biggest problems first and avoid getting distracted by minor things. Here‚Äôs his approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>List the top issues. Go around the room and have everyone share what they saw as the three biggest problems. Write them down‚Äîno discussion yet, just listing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize. Once you‚Äôve got the list, pick the ten most important problems and rank them from worst to least urgent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a plan. For each of the top problems, figure out how you‚Äôll fix it, who will handle it, and what resources they‚Äôll need. The goal isn‚Äôt to fix every problem perfectly, but to make enough progress that the big issues are no longer deal-breakers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Krug‚Äôs advice is also to resist the urge to add more stuff when users are confused. Instead of piling on explanations, sometimes the best solution is to take things away and make the page simpler. And if a user suggests a new feature, take it with a grain of salt because they‚Äôll often realize that they wouldn‚Äôt even use it themselves.</p>

<p>If I had to choose one word to capture Chapter 8, it would be &quot;Perspective&quot;. This chapter highlights how our professional and personal perspectives shape, and often complicate, our approach to usability in design. Designers, developers, marketers, and all other roles bring their own strong beliefs about what makes a great user experience. This can often clashing over details based on what matters most to them. For designers, it might be the visual aesthetic of a page, while for developers, it‚Äôs the clever and efficient functionality. And because we‚Äôre all technology users, we tend to project our preferences onto others, assuming other people want what we like.</p>
<p>This concept of perspective is important for me to remember in my career because it emphasizes the importance of staying open-minded. Recognizing different perspectives helps shift the focus from what I or others think users want to what users actually need. That‚Äôs where usability testing becomes essential. By stepping outside of our personal viewpoints, we can rely on user feedback to ground our designs in real-world use. This perspective shift can make decisions easier and lead to better, more user-focused designs that work for everyone.</p>

<p>Providing feedback to designers is like giving instructions to a chef. If you say, ‚ÄúMake me something delicious,‚Äù the chef has to guess what you like, and the result might not align with your expectations. However, if you‚Äôre clear and specific, the chef has the guidance needed to create something that satisfies your taste and dietary needs. Just as a chef benefits from understanding your preferences and restrictions, a designer needs actionable and detailed feedback to craft a design that matches your vision.</p>
<p>Designers, much like chefs, work with ‚Äúingredients‚Äù: color palettes, typography, layouts, user interactions, etc. These elements can be combined in lots of ways, and without guidance, a designer may produce work that doesn‚Äôt fully meet your goals or needs. Just as vague feedback leaves a chef guessing, it leaves a designer uncertain about your expectations. Precise feedback, on the other hand, empowers both the chef and the designer to make creative choices that are aligned with the intended outcome.</p>
<p>As I prepare to transition into a full-time career in software development, the importance of effective communication is becoming increasingly clear. Whether I‚Äôm collaborating with designers, other developers, or stakeholders, being able to provide meaningful feedback will be critical. When working with designers in particular, understanding how to deliver feedback that is specific, constructive, and tied to project goals can make all the difference.</p>

<p>In Chapter 7 of Don‚Äôt Make Me Think, Krug highlights the importance of a seamless and intuitive user experience. One of the main takeaways is the concept of &quot;the first law of usability,&quot; which states that a user interface should be self-evident. This means that users shouldn‚Äôt have to think too much to understand how something works; they should be able to glance at a webpage or an app and know immediately what to do. This principle is central to creating effective digital experiences because it reduces cognitive load and frustration. This allows users to focus on their goals rather than trying to figure out confusing navigation or design elements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Presentation Zen (Chapters 2 and 4) by Reynolds focuses on effective presentation design, with an emphasis on simplicity and storytelling. In Chapter 2, Reynolds introduces the idea of &quot;restraint&quot; in design, using only what is necessary to convey your message without overwhelming your audience with excessive text, data, etc. Chapter 4 expands on this by discussing the importance of visual clarity and the power of storytelling. A compelling narrative paired with clean, minimal slides can make presentations more engaging.</p>
<p>When we merge these ideas from both books, the ideas of simplicity, clarity, and engagement are apparent, whether you&#x27;re designing a user interface or delivering a presentation. In both cases, the goal is to guide your audience without distracting or confusing them. Just as Krug advises designers to create user interfaces that don&#x27;t require thought, Reynolds advises presenters to strip away unnecessary clutter so that the core message stands out.</p>
<p>As someone working in software development, these lessons are incredibly relevant. Whether I‚Äôm collaborating on a UI project or preparing a presentation, balancing simplicity and engagement will be important. In user interface design, I‚Äôve learned that every additional button, menu, or piece of text is a potential point of confusion for the user. The more straightforward the interface, the easier it will be for the user to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>This piece does a good job at demonstrating how each of the portfolios are unique and show off the designer&#x27;s individuality, but still manages to be consistent and easy to use. Each designer has their own style, creativity, and perspective, which helps communicate who they are and what they&#x27;re all about. Even though the designs are different, they all follow good usability practices, making it easy for viewers to navigate and understand the content.</p>
<p>This balance between individuality and consistency is very important for UX portfolios. It lets designers express their unique approach while making sure the portfolio is still accessible and user-friendly. Consistent navigation, typography, and structure create a familiar experience for viewers, while unique visual elements, color schemes, and personal touches make the portfolio stand out and be memorable.</p>
<p>For my career, I think it&#x27;s important to remember that a good portfolio isn&#x27;t just about showing off creativity, it&#x27;s also about making sure the user experience is smooth and easy. By combining both individuality and consistency, I can create a portfolio that not only grabs attention but also communicates my design skills and thought process effectively.</p>

(2006). Don&#x27;t make me think! A common sense approach to web usability (2nd ed.). New Riders. and Breck, Colin. ‚ÄúUnderstanding Our Core Values: An Exercise for Individuals and Teams.‚Äù Colin Breck&#x27;s Blog, 2 Feb. 2020</em></p>
<p>In Don&#x27;t Make Me Think, Chapter 6, Steve Krug emphasizes the importance of making web design intuitive. With good design, users should be able to easily navigate without stopping to figure out what to do. The word that perfectly sums this up is &quot;clarity.&quot; To me, this means more than just good design - it also is about how we communicate, solve problems, and collaborate.</p>
<p>When I read about core values in Colin Breck‚Äôs blog, the same idea of clarity stood out. Clear communication and transparent values help teams work smoothly, just like how clear design helps users move effortlessly through a website. It‚Äôs about reducing the mental load, whether for users or colleagues, so they can focus on what really matters.</p>
<p>In my career as a software engineer, I know how important it is to keep things clear, whether it‚Äôs in code, documentation, or interface design. Without clarity, people get stuck, frustrated, or lost. By sticking to this value in my work, I‚Äôll not only make better products but also contribute to stronger, more effective teams.</p>
<p>Whether I‚Äôm building an app or collaborating with a team, I want everything to be straightforward and easy to understand. That way, we can focus on creating great experiences and solving real problems.</p>

<p>The art piece I found inspiration in is Hot Dog Bridge by Russell T. Gordon. This is a six-color lithograph created in 1974 and is part of the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln&#x27;s collection, gifted by Dr. Christopher and Janet Graf. Gordon, an American artist, was born in Philadelphia in 1936 and later passed in Montreal in 2013. The artwork portrays a surreal scene where a hot dog stretches across two canyon-like formations, set against a vivid background featuring a bright blue sky, white clouds, and a rainbow. This whimsical combination of elements evokes nostalgia, inviting viewers to embrace humor and lightheartedness during challenging times.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Color Balance</li>
</ol>
<p>The vibrant color palette used in Hot Dog Bridge immediately grabs attention. The contrast between the bright blue sky, the bold rainbow, and the warm tones of the rocks creates a balanced and dynamic visual experience. The hot dog, an iconic and familiar object, stands out against the surreal background and magnifies the humor in the piece. The combination of these bold and simplified colors creates a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Joseph Albers‚Äô Interaction of Color, which discusses the importance of contrast in evoking emotion through colors.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Surrealism and Humor</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance, the piece&#x27;s absurdity is what draws you in. A hot dog spanning a canyon is not a typical sight. This constract between reality and imagination is central to surrealism. It encourages people to find meaning in the nonsensical, which is exactly what happened for me while viewing this piece. The surreal nature of the work, paired with its lighthearted humor, represents a comforting escape from ther seriousness and challenges of the &quot;real-world&quot;.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Salvador Dal√≠‚Äôs works, which often use juxtaposition to inspire thought beyond the obvious.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Simplicity of Forms</li>
</ol>
<p>Gordon&#x27;s use of clean, simplified shapes, like geometric clouds, smooth curves of the hot dog, and blocky rocks creates a unified look that is easy to process visually. Despite the bizarre concept, the clarity and simplicity of the forms make it accessible to viewers. This is a prime example of how minimalistic design choices can strengthen the overall impact of a surreal composition, allowing each element to stand out clearly.</p>
<p><em>The above ideas are influenced by Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s Point and Line to Plane, which offers insights into how basic forms and geometry influence perception in art.</em></p>
<p><strong>UI Sketch</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/hotdogUISketch-c34a84bc1f5379c13d755a73ca557c45.jpg" width="2302" height="2615" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This hand-drawn sketch above represents a mobile app screen. The inspiration behind this idea was the way that I open up my notes app nearly every day to make quick to-do lists, often with only a couple of items. I thought it would be much more fun if my lists were more whimsy and playful, like this piece of art. So, the main functionality is a simple todo list, where the user drags the hot dog across the canyon once they complete a task, symbolizing the &quot;bridge&quot; of completing a task. So, the hot dog would start short and end up quite long.</p>
<p>I felt that displaying a hand-drawn sketch alone would not capture everything I was inspired by. Color, whim, surrealism, and humor were main aspects of my inspiration, so I did a quick design on Canva to try to convey the playful vibe I wanted to display, as color is very important to my thoughts on this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Error getting image" src="/erin-ui-portfolio2/assets/images/hotdogUI-bbfbf9480f16219f6b74a27935b431e8.png" width="584" height="1008" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Through this process, I‚Äôve learned how surrealist art can inspire UI design by embracing imagination and playfulness, even in something as simple and mundane as a to-do app. Using bold colors and simplifying forms allows a balance between creative inspiration and accessibility, making interfaces both functional and delightful.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">About Me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/erin-ui-portfolio2/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/ecase6/erin-ui-portfolio2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2024 My UI Portfolio.
