# Navigation and Values
*In response to Chapter 6 of: Krug, S. (2006). Don't make me think! A common sense approach to web usability (2nd ed.). New Riders. and Breck, Colin. “Understanding Our Core Values: An Exercise for Individuals and Teams.” Colin Breck's Blog, 2 Feb. 2020*

In Don't Make Me Think, Chapter 6, Steve Krug emphasizes the importance of making web design intuitive. With good design, users should be able to easily navigate without stopping to figure out what to do. The word that perfectly sums this up is "clarity." To me, this means more than just good design - it also is about how we communicate, solve problems, and collaborate.

When I read about core values in Colin Breck’s blog, the same idea of clarity stood out. Clear communication and transparent values help teams work smoothly, just like how clear design helps users move effortlessly through a website. It’s about reducing the mental load, whether for users or colleagues, so they can focus on what really matters.

In my career as a software engineer, I know how important it is to keep things clear, whether it’s in code, documentation, or interface design. Without clarity, people get stuck, frustrated, or lost. By sticking to this value in my work, I’ll not only make better products but also contribute to stronger, more effective teams.

Whether I’m building an app or collaborating with a team, I want everything to be straightforward and easy to understand. That way, we can focus on creating great experiences and solving real problems.
