# Inclusive Design 2
*In response to The Design of Everyday Things Chapter 4 by Don Norman*

Reading about how we approach using something completely unfamiliar, I thought about the way we rely on two distinct kinds of knowledge: what’s in the world around us and what’s in our heads.

The chapter explained how physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints help us make decisions. These constraints are like silent guides, reducing the chances of making mistakes by narrowing down the set of possible actions. When we combine these with the mental models we’ve built over time, we can operate complex or unfamiliar objects surprisingly easy.

What really sticks with me is the balance between design and our natural ability to adapt. As a future developer, I want to think about both the external and internal ways people make sense of what I create. It’s not just about coding something that works, it’s about designing in a way that guides users effortlessly through the experience. This approach doesn’t just make things easier to use, it makes them feel intuitive.

This kind of knowledge is like learning a new language that we can "read" without words, just by looking at a well-designed object or interface. The world is full of signals, and learning to interpret them (or create them, in my case) is both an art and a science.
