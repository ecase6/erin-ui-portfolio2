# Portfolios & Design Narratives
*In response to https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-portfolio-examples/*

This piece does a good job at demonstrating how each of the portfolios are unique and show off the designer's individuality, but still manages to be consistent and easy to use. Each designer has their own style, creativity, and perspective, which helps communicate who they are and what they're all about. Even though the designs are different, they all follow good usability practices, making it easy for viewers to navigate and understand the content.

This balance between individuality and consistency is very important for UX portfolios. It lets designers express their unique approach while making sure the portfolio is still accessible and user-friendly. Consistent navigation, typography, and structure create a familiar experience for viewers, while unique visual elements, color schemes, and personal touches make the portfolio stand out and be memorable.

For my career, I think it's important to remember that a good portfolio isn't just about showing off creativity, it's also about making sure the user experience is smooth and easy. By combining both individuality and consistency, I can create a portfolio that not only grabs attention but also communicates my design skills and thought process effectively.
