# The Making of My Portfolio

The following are the Design Requirements for my portfolio, in accordance to Stephanie Valentine for UNL's Raikes Course: Honors User Interfaces. The date on this post is listed as August 1st, but it was actually created on December 13th. I backdated it to avoid disrupting the flow of my recent posts. This post is temporary and will be deleted in January, as itâ€™s for an assignment and not intended to be a permanent part of my portfolio.

- Clean, intuitive navigation

My site is minimalistic and easy to navigate. On the home page, there are only 3 cards that the user can choose to click on, or they can navigate to different parts of the site using the top navigation bar. There is no "clutter" or unneccesary information. 

- Intentional color choices

I chose a blue color theme, as it is a calming color that is complementary to photos that I use on the site (e.g., the *Crafty* logo is also blue). Blue is also my favorite color, so it feels true to me to have that be the theme of my portfolio. The other colors are very neutral, which lets my pictures and embedded prototypes "do the talking".

- Harmony between affordances and signifiers

The affordances and signifiers are intuitive and inline with what's commonly seen in other places online. If things are clickable, the cursor turns into the "click" cursor. Words that are for navigation that can be clicked turn blue when hovered. Links within the text are blue, and they're underlined when the user hovers them. When anything is clicked, it leads the user to where they expected to go.

- Some consideration to accessibility (e.g., use of HTML header tags, alt text, etc.)

I made sure that the colors I chose provided good contrast. I also chose font sizes and colors that were readable. Everything on the site is simple to use and navigate. Users can also navigate easily through the site by tabbing rather than clicking. I ran a Lighthouse report on my site, and it got a 96%. 

- Usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.)

I used headings to organize content and make it easier to digest. I also used spacing throughout the website to make things easier to read and understand. In large areas of text (e.g., blogs), I use bulleted lists if necessary to organize information.  

- Evidence of evolution (I started there, but I learned some stuff, and now I'm here)

This is most obviously seen in my Design Narrative. It goes through the evolution of my design and contains insights that I learned along the way. It's also displayed in my Projects page, as I have all of my prototypes that I made, from start to finish, on that page.

- Proper attribution of others' work (especially in your reading reflections)

I attribute the class (Raikes UI/UX) in my About Me page. I also display the name of the author whose work I was responding to, along with the title of the work.

- Intentional integration of your values

My Design Narrative explains the integration of my values in my work. My projects all display these values. I also talk about creativity in my About Me page, which relates to the value of playfulness. Any time I wrote text for the site, it was in my voice/tone, which is often playful as well. My whole site is organized, clean, and intuitive - as organization is one of my values.
