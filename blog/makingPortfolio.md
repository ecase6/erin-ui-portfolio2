# The Making of My Portfolio

The following are the Design Requirements for my portfolio, in accordance to Stephanie Valentine for UNL's Raikes Course: Honors User Interfaces. The date on this post is listed as August 1st, but it was actually created on December 13th. I backdated it to avoid disrupting the flow of my recent posts. This post is temporary and will be deleted in January, as itâ€™s for an assignment and not intended to be a permanent part of my portfolio.

- Clean, intuitive navigation
My site is minimalistic and easy to navigate. On the home page, there are only 3 cards that the user can choose to click on, or they can navigate to different parts of the site using the top navigation bar. There is no "clutter" or unneccesary information. 

- Intentional color choices
I chose a blue color theme, as it is a calming color that is complementary to photos that I use on the site (e.g., the *Crafty* logo is also blue). Blue is also my favorite color, so it feels true to me to have that be the theme of my portfolio. The other colors are very neutral, which lets my pictures and embedded prototypes "do the talking".

- Harmony between affordances and signifiers

- Some consideration to accessibility (e.g., use of HTML header tags, alt text, etc.)
- Usability elements to help make content easier to digest (bulleted lists, pagination, expandable blocks, headings, etc.)
- Evidence of evolution (I started there, but I learned some stuff, and now I'm here)
- Proper attribution of others' work (especially in your reading reflections)
- Intentional integration of your values
