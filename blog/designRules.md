# Design Rules
*In response to Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of: Krug, S. (2006). Don't make me think! A common sense approach to web usability (2nd ed.). New Riders.*

Scanning and Satisficing from Chapter 2 emphasize that users donâ€™t consume information in a linear way, or read everything. This is why Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) and the use of Conventions are important. If a website or app follows established patterns, it makes it easier for users to look through and find what they need.

The relationship between Navigation Clarity (Chapter 4) and Visual Hierarchy (Chapter 3) is crucial. A well-designed hierarchy can improve navigation by highlighting what's important and where users need to go (e.g., having breadcrumbs). Together, these help users feel in control and avoid getting lost.

Minimizing unnecessary text (Chapter 5) works hand-in-hand with reducing visual noise (Chapter 3). This combination helps reduce cognitive load, making it easier for users to process content quickly without being overwhelmed. Clickability from Chapter 3 also ties into this, as clear, concise instructions should guide users to the right actions.

Across all chapters, Krug reinforces that the core focus should always be usability, whether through simplifying text, improving navigation, or designing with conventions in mind. Each chapter adds another layer to this, highlighting that the easier we make it for users, the more successful the product will be.

Understanding these relationships is important to create user-friendly apps/websites. By internalizing how users think and interact with digital products, I'll be able to design solutions that reduce frustration, improve engagement, and lead to better overall satisfaction. Whether I'm developing a database or designing a feature in my future software engineering work, these ideas will be helpful while trying to create intuitive, effective solutions.
