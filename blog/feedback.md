# Feedback Workshop
*In response to https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/give-designers-feedback/*

Providing feedback to designers is like giving instructions to a chef. If you say, “Make me something delicious,” the chef has to guess what you like, and the result might not align with your expectations. However, if you’re clear and specific, the chef has the guidance needed to create something that satisfies your taste and dietary needs. Just as a chef benefits from understanding your preferences and restrictions, a designer needs actionable and detailed feedback to craft a design that matches your vision.

Designers, much like chefs, work with “ingredients”: color palettes, typography, layouts, user interactions, etc. These elements can be combined in lots of ways, and without guidance, a designer may produce work that doesn’t fully meet your goals or needs. Just as vague feedback leaves a chef guessing, it leaves a designer uncertain about your expectations. Precise feedback, on the other hand, empowers both the chef and the designer to make creative choices that are aligned with the intended outcome.

As I prepare to transition into a full-time career in software development, the importance of effective communication is becoming increasingly clear. Whether I’m collaborating with designers, other developers, or stakeholders, being able to provide meaningful feedback will be critical. When working with designers in particular, understanding how to deliver feedback that is specific, constructive, and tied to project goals can make all the difference.
